## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### For Every New Notice/Email:

1. **Check Signature**: Is there a legible, identifiable name?
2. **Verify Authority**: Is this person listed in a ¬ß1962 disclosure?
3. **Document Service**: How was it delivered? Keep envelopes!
4. **Check Purpose**: Is it lawful under ¬ß1954 or pretextual?
5. **Track Frequency**: Add to harassment timeline
6. **Preserve Evidence**: Screenshot, save, photograph immediately

### Legal Remedies Available:

- **Rent Withholding**: During ¬ß1962 noncompliance period
- **Eviction Defense**: Multiple notice defects available
- **Harassment Claims**: $2,000 per violation
- **Trespass Charges**: For unauthorized entries (Dean)
- **Retaliation Defense**: Clear pattern established
- **Discovery Sanctions**: For "Stoneman Staff" obfuscation

### Critical Timeline:

- **Nov 24, 2024**: "Dean & Gail Houser" identify as "primary contacts" with individual names
- **Nov 29, 2024**: Pattern switches to anonymous signatures  
- **March 2025**: Unauthorized recording of minors
- **March 21, 2025**: Attorney involvement begins
- **March 2025**: 23 entry notices (harassment spike)
- **May 29, 2025**: "No legal requirement" admission
- **June 2, 2025**: Finally names team (after 3 months) but keeps using "Stoneman Staff"
- **Aug 18, 2025**: Illegible signature on legal notice

## üìã PATTERN SUMMARY

**Systematic Avoidance of Individual Accountability Through:**

1. **Email Communications**: 93 emails, 100% avoid individual identification
2. **Physical Notices**: Illegible signatures, no printed names
3. **Legal Defiance**: "No legal requirement" despite ¬ß1962
4. **Rotating Ambiguity**: Gail (29), Brad (3), Dean (4), but mostly "Staff" (57)
5. **Harassment Pattern**: 23 notices in one month after complaints
6. **Dean's Shadow Role**: Never disclosed, but actively entering/inspecting

**Result**: Complete frustration of tenant's legal right to know who is accountable for:
- Unauthorized recording of minors
- Excessive entry demands
- Mold/health hazards
- Legal notice compliance
