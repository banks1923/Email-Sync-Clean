I want to clarify that, under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), I’m not required to sign additional documents for my emotional support animal to be approved. Approval should be based on the documentation I’ve already provided

> Dear Jennifer,
Section 13 of the signed lease states that no animal or pet shall be kept on or about the premises without our prior written consent. If this process had been followed originally, we would have asked for the ATCA to be completed

We’ve received two different notices about moving out, and with the deadline approaching quickly, we want to ensure there are no misunderstandings. We would like to know which notice to follow so that we can make the appropriate plans and avoid potential delays

Thank you for confirming that the notice provided on August 23, 2024, with a vacate date of September 8, 2024, is the effective notice. Which indicates the initial notice provided on June 19, 2024 with the vacate date of September 15, 2024 is no longer valid
