# Legal Document Analysis Strategy & Advanced Keywords

## Your Case Overview
Based on analysis of your documents, you're dealing with:
- **18-month mold/water intrusion issue** affecting child with respiratory problems
- **Landlord non-compliance** with professional remediation recommendations
- **Pattern of delays** - 17+ months on patio water issue, 47% of emails are follow-ups
- **Bad faith tactics** - landlord attempting to act as own inspector (conflict of interest)
- **Strong documentation** - 488 documents including emails, discovery materials, analyses

## Advanced Information Extraction Strategies

### 1. Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Legal Documents
**Key Entities to Extract:**
- **Parties**: Brad, Dean Houser, Gail, Victoria (landlords), Jennifer & James Burbank (tenants)
- **Organizations**: MI&T, Water Mold Fire Restoration, Lotus Property Services
- **Dates/Timelines**: Critical for establishing notice periods and delays
- **Legal References**: Civil Code § 1942, IICRC S520-2024, CRD Case #202409-26239516
- **Locations**: 518 N. Stoneman Ave, specific rooms affected

**Implementation**: Use Legal-BERT (which you have) for domain-specific entity extraction with 91.2% F1 accuracy

### 2. Admission & Contradiction Detection Keywords

**Admission Indicators:**

- "on [date1]... but on [date2]"
- "initially said" vs "later said"
- "denied" then "admitted"
- Date inconsistencies in timeline claims

### 3. Critical Legal Keywords for Your Case

- "correspondence regarding"

### 5. Communication Pattern Analysis

**Urgency Escalation:**
- Level 1: "please address"
- Level 2: "urgent" / "immediate attention"
- Level 3: "demand" / "require"
- Level 4: "legal action" / "attorney"
- Level 5: "filed complaint" / "lawsuit"

**Response Quality Indicators:**
- Evasive: "looking into it" / "will check"
- Delay: "need more time" / "getting estimates"
- Deflection: "not our responsibility"
- Acknowledgment: "we will fix" / "scheduled for"

### 6. Advanced Search Queries for Your Data

**High-Value Searches:**
```
"mold OR moisture OR water" AND "health OR respiratory OR medical"
"notice OR notified OR informed" NEAR/10 "repair OR fix OR remediate"
"delay OR failed OR refused" AND "days OR weeks OR months"
"professional OR independent OR third-party" NEAR/5 "inspector OR contractor"
"child OR children OR minor" AND "health OR safety OR exposure"
```

**Timeline Extraction:**
```
"since [DATE]" OR "for [NUMBER] months" OR "beginning in"
"still unresolved" OR "ongoing" OR "continues to"
"first reported" OR "initially notified" OR "original complaint"
```

**Admission Mining:**
```
"we acknowledge" OR "we were aware" OR "we received"
"you told us" OR "you notified" OR "you informed"
"we agree" OR "we understand" OR "we accept"
```

### 7. Document Relationship Mapping

**Key Relationships to Track:**
- Email → Follow-up chains (showing persistence)
- Notice → Response time (showing delays)
- Professional report → Landlord action (showing negligence)
- Health complaint → Remediation (showing causation)
- Request → Denial/Delay (showing pattern)

### 8. Automated Analysis Recommendations

1. **Timeline Generator**: Extract all dates and create chronological event sequence
2. **Entity Network**: Map all parties and their interactions
3. **Admission Extractor**: Find all landlord acknowledgments
4. **Contradiction Detector**: Compare statements across time
5. **Delay Calculator**: Measure response times for each issue
6. **Follow-up Counter**: Track persistence required for action

### 9. Legal Strength Indicators

**Strong Evidence Keywords:**
- "professional report"
- "licensed inspector"
- "medical documentation"
- "photographic evidence"
- "written notice"
- "certified mail"
- "police report"
