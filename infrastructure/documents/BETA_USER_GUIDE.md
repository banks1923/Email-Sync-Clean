# Email Sync Beta Test User Guide

Welcome to the Email Sync System Beta Test! This guide will help you get started with testing the AI-powered search system.

## Quick Start

### 1. System Requirements
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum (for Legal BERT model)
- **Disk Space**: 2GB free (1.3GB for model download on first run)

### 2. First Run Setup

When you run the system for the first time, it will:
1. Download the Legal BERT model (1.3GB) - this is a one-time download
2. Initialize the SQLite database
3. Create data pipeline directories
4. Start in keyword search mode (vector search optional)

### 3. Basic Commands

#### Search for Content
```bash
# Simple search across all content
scripts/vsearch search "contract terms"

# Search with date filters
scripts/vsearch search "meeting notes" --since "last week"
scripts/vsearch search "invoice" --since "2024-01-01" --until "2024-06-30"

# Search by content type
scripts/vsearch search "important" --type email
scripts/vsearch search "agreement" --type pdf

# Search with tags
scripts/vsearch search "urgent" --tag legal --tag priority
```

#### Process Documents
```bash
# Upload a single PDF
scripts/vsearch upload document.pdf

# Upload multiple PDFs from a directory
scripts/vsearch upload /path/to/documents/

# The system automatically:
# - Detects if OCR is needed for scanned PDFs
# - Extracts text and metadata
# - Generates summaries (5 sentences, 15 keywords)
# - Creates searchable content
```

#### Sync Gmail (Optional)
```bash
# First time setup (opens browser for authentication)
scripts/vsearch sync-gmail

# Subsequent syncs (incremental, only new emails)
scripts/vsearch sync-gmail

# The system automatically:
# - Deduplicates emails
# - Extracts metadata
# - Generates summaries (3 sentences, 10 keywords)
```

#### System Information
```bash
# Check system status
scripts/vsearch info

# View help
scripts/vsearch --help
```

## Key Features to Test

### 1. Smart Search
The system uses AI to understand your search intent:
- **Query Expansion**: "LLC" automatically searches for "limited liability company"
- **Semantic Search**: Finds related concepts, not just keyword matches
- **Entity Recognition**: Identifies people, organizations, dates, and legal terms

### 2. Document Intelligence
- **Automatic Summarization**: Every document gets AI-generated summaries
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies key people, organizations, and dates
- **Relationship Discovery**: Finds connections between documents

### 3. Advanced Filtering
- **Natural Language Dates**: Use "yesterday", "last week", "3 days ago"
- **Multiple Filters**: Combine date, type, and tag filters
- **Tag Logic**: Use AND/OR logic for tag combinations

## Beta Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Document Upload and Search
1. Upload a PDF document:
   ```bash
   scripts/vsearch upload test_document.pdf
   ```
2. Search for content from the document:
   ```bash
   scripts/vsearch search "keywords from document"
   ```
3. Try semantic search for related concepts

### Scenario 2: Email Search (if using Gmail)
1. Sync your emails:
   ```bash
   scripts/vsearch sync-gmail
   ```
2. Search with filters:
   ```bash
   scripts/vsearch search "meeting" --since "last month" --type email
   ```

### Scenario 3: Intelligence Features
1. Find similar documents:
   ```bash
   # After uploading multiple documents
   scripts/vsearch search "main topic" --limit 5
   ```
2. The system will show related documents based on content similarity

## Monitoring Your Test

### Check System Health
```bash
# Run the monitoring script
python scripts/beta_monitor.py --report

# For continuous monitoring (runs every 60 seconds)
python scripts/beta_monitor.py --continuous
```

### Performance Expectations
- **Search Response**: Should be under 2 seconds
- **PDF Processing**: 5-10 seconds per document
- **Email Sync**: ~50 emails per minute
- **Memory Usage**: Should stay under 500MB

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Search returns no results
**Solution**: Check if content is indexed:
```bash
scripts/vsearch info  # Shows content counts
```

### Issue: Slow search performance
**Solution**: System may be using keyword search. To enable faster semantic search:
1. Install Qdrant (optional): See main README
2. Restart the search to use vector search

### Issue: PDF upload fails
**Possible causes**:
- PDF may be corrupted
- Insufficient permissions
- Check `data/quarantine/` for failed files

### Issue: High memory usage
**Solution**: This is normal during model loading. Memory usage should stabilize after initial load.

## Providing Feedback

### What We Need to Know
1. **Search Accuracy**: Are you finding what you're looking for?
2. **Performance**: Are operations fast enough?
3. **Ease of Use**: Is the system intuitive?
4. **Errors**: Any crashes or unexpected behavior?
5. **Feature Requests**: What's missing that you need?

### How to Report Issues
1. **Collect Information**:
   - What command did you run?
   - What was the expected result?
   - What actually happened?
   - Any error messages?

2. **Check Logs**:
   - Look at `beta_monitor.log` for system logs
   - Include relevant log entries in your report

3. **Submit Feedback**:
   - Email: [beta-feedback@example.com]
   - GitHub Issues: [repository-url]/issues
   - Include your `beta_monitor_report.md` if possible

## Advanced Features (Optional)

### Enable Semantic Search
For better search results, you can enable vector-based semantic search:

1. Install Qdrant locally (no Docker needed):
   ```bash
   # See main README for installation instructions
   ```

2. The system will automatically detect and use Qdrant when available

### Use MCP Tools in Claude Desktop
If you're using Claude Desktop, the system provides advanced tools:
- Legal intelligence analysis
- Document relationship mapping
- Timeline generation
- Entity extraction

## Safety and Privacy

### Your Data
- All data stays local on your machine
- No external services except optional Gmail API
- Database stored in local SQLite file
- Vectors stored locally in Qdrant (if enabled)

### Backup
Your data is stored in:
- `email_sync.db` - Main database
- `data/` - Document pipeline
- `qdrant_data/` - Vector embeddings (if enabled)

Back up these directories to preserve your data.

## Known Limitations

1. **First Run**: Initial model download takes time (1.3GB)
2. **Memory**: Requires 4GB RAM for Legal BERT model
3. **OCR**: Large scanned PDFs may take longer to process
4. **Batch Limits**: Email sync processes 500 emails at a time
