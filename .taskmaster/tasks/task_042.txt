# Task ID: 42
# Title: Refactor CLI handlers and service orchestrator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 41
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update 7 CLI scripts and pipeline orchestrator to use new functions, remove deprecated imports.
# Details:
1. tools/scripts/cli/*.py – import search_intelligence.search.
2. Update argument parsing to include new limit bounds.
3. Add --validate flag to run validators only.

# Test Strategy:
• Invoke each CLI with --help – no stack trace.
• End-to-end test: pipeline orchestrator runs successfully in staging DB.
