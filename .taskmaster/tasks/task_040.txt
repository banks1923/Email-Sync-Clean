# Task ID: 40
# Title: Revise and expand automated test suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 39
# Priority: high
# Description: Update 15 affected test files to new API and add dedicated security, performance, and boundary tests.
# Details:
1. Refactor existing tests to import search, find_literal.
2. Create tests/test_semantic_search_security.py implementing SQLi & boundary tests.
3. Add batch enrichment stress test with pytest-benchmark.
4. Update fixtures paths as needed.

# Test Strategy:
• `pytest -n auto` all green.
• Security tests intentionally inject malicious input – expect ValidationError.
• Coverage ≥ 90%.
