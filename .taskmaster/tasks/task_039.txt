# Task ID: 39
# Title: Delete compatibility shims and other dead hybrid-search code
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 38
# Priority: medium
# Description: Purge outdated functions, __init__ alias exports, and hybrid search remnants to reduce architectural debt.
# Details:
1. Identify shims via TODO/HYBRID_SEARCH comments.
2. Remove modules; adjust imports.
3. Ensure none exceed 450 lines after cleanup.

# Test Strategy:
• Coverage run – unchanged % after deletion.
• Static import check: `python -m pip install check-imports`; expect pass.
