# Task ID: 45
# Title: Final performance benchmarking & validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 40, 42, 43
# Priority: medium
# Description: Run load tests, ensure success criteria met, and tag release.
# Details:
1. Use Locust to simulate 20 concurrent searches of 100 results → <1s avg.
2. Memory profiling with tracemalloc – peak <100 MB.
3. Run full security scan (bandit, safety).
4. Tag v1.3.0-semantic-fix in git.

# Test Strategy:
• Attach locust report; assert KPIs.
• CI pipeline must pass security gates.
• Manual smoke test via CLI & MCP.
