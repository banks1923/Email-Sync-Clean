			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down directory creation into: 1) Create analog_db root with subdirectories (documents/, email_threads/, originals/) 2) Implement pathlib-based cross-platform directory creation with proper error handling 3) Add validation and permissions checking for created directories",
			"reasoning": "Simple file system operations using pathlib. Project already has similar directory management in SimpleDB._ensure_data_directories() and DataPipelineOrchestrator. Low complexity due to straightforward requirements and existing patterns."
