		{
			"taskId": 29,
			"taskTitle": "Create migration system directory structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down migration system setup into: 1) Create migrations directory structure, 2) Generate initial schema baseline SQL from existing database, 3) Create empty migration files for new columns, 4) Set up tracking mechanism for applied migrations",
			"reasoning": "Simple directory creation and file setup task. The codebase already has established patterns for directory structure (seen in utilities/, infrastructure/). No existing migrations directory found. Requires creating 4-5 files and directories with basic SQL content."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 30,
			"taskTitle": "Implement core SimpleDB missing methods",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Implement get_all_content_ids method with optional content_type filtering, 2) Add comprehensive tests to verify the method works with different scenarios",
			"reasoning": "Very straightforward task. SimpleDB already has 47 methods and established patterns. The adapter shows the exact implementation needed (lines 21-44). Just needs to be moved into SimpleDB proper - about 15 lines of code."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 31,
			"taskTitle": "Implement batch content retrieval methods",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Implement get_content_by_ids with SQLite 500-item chunking logic, 2) Add helper method for chunk iteration, 3) Write tests for edge cases including large batches over 1500 items",
			"reasoning": "Slightly more complex due to SQLite chunking requirement. The adapter already shows the pattern (lines 46-74). SimpleDB has existing batch methods to reference (batch_insert at line 549). Requires proper chunking implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 32,
			"taskTitle": "Add vectorization marking methods",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Implement mark_content_vectorized for single updates, 2) Implement batch_mark_vectorized with 500-item chunking, 3) Add tests for both methods including idempotency checks",
			"reasoning": "Similar complexity to task 31. Follows established patterns in SimpleDB for update operations (update_content at line 341). Adapter shows the needed functionality. Requires chunking for batch operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 33,
			"taskTitle": "Create SQL migration for missing columns",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Write ALTER TABLE statements for the three new columns, 2) Add CREATE INDEX statements for performance, 3) Include safety checks and rollback considerations",
			"reasoning": "Simple SQL file creation. The content table structure is visible in tests/conftest.py. Just needs ALTER TABLE statements for 3 columns. Very straightforward SQL work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 34,
			"taskTitle": "Implement migration runner script",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement as: 1) Create basic migrate.py structure with file discovery, 2) Add tracking file reading/writing logic, 3) Implement SQL execution with error handling, 4) Add dry-run mode for testing, 5) Include logging and progress reporting",
			"reasoning": "More complex standalone script. Needs file I/O, SQL execution, error handling, and tracking. SimpleDB's execute method can be referenced. Must be under 30 lines which requires concise implementation."

			"complexityScore": 1,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Single atomic change - remove save_to_db=True parameter from line 416",
			"reasoning": "Trivial one-line change. Just delete the parameter from the method call. No subtasks needed for such a simple fix."

			"taskTitle": "Remove adapter imports from gmail",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Remove EmailThreadAdapter import and instantiation, 2) Update process_thread call to use thread_processor directly",
			"reasoning": "Simple refactoring. Remove 2 lines (import and adapter creation) and change 1 line (method call). Code shows exact location at lines 411-417."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 37,
			"taskTitle": "Remove VectorMaintenanceAdapter usage",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement as: 1) Remove adapter import and change initialization to use SimpleDB directly, 2) Verify all vector maintenance operations still work",
			"reasoning": "Simple change at lines 38-39 of vector_maintenance.py. Just remove adapter wrapper. Depends on SimpleDB having the required methods from tasks 30-32."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 38,
			"taskTitle": "Delete compatibility helper methods",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Remove _db_get_all_content_ids helper method, 2) Remove other compatibility helpers and update references, 3) Test all vector operations still function",
			"reasoning": "Need to remove helper methods (lines 44-72) and update all references throughout the file. Requires finding and updating multiple call sites."

			"taskTitle": "Remove save_to_db from test files",
			"complexityScore": 1,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Remove save_to_db=True from two test method calls at lines 342 and 379",
			"reasoning": "Trivial two-line change in test file. Just remove the parameter from two locations. No subtasks needed."

			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Execute as: 1) Verify no remaining adapter imports in codebase, 2) Delete the adapters/ directory and all files, 3) Run full test suite to confirm no breakage",
			"reasoning": "Simple deletion task but needs verification. Found 4 adapter files to remove. Must ensure no imports remain after deletion."

			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement incrementally: 1) Create preflight.py with basic structure, 2) Add Qdrant connection check, 3) Add embedding service validation, 4) Add database schema checks, 5) Add SimpleDB method verification, 6) Implement error aggregation and reporting",
			"reasoning": "Most complex task. Needs to check multiple services, handle various failure modes, and provide clear error messages. Requires integration with multiple components (Qdrant, embeddings, database)."

			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Test embedding generation with sample text, 2) Verify 1024 dimensions and L2 normalization, 3) Add specific error messages for dimension/normalization failures",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity. Embedding service already has L2 normalization (lines 80-83). Needs to verify output characteristics and provide clear diagnostics."

			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement as: 1) Query database schema using PRAGMA table_info, 2) Check for all required columns, 3) Provide migration command in error message if columns missing",
			"reasoning": "Requires PRAGMA queries and column validation. Test fixtures show expected schema structure. Need to compare actual vs expected columns."
