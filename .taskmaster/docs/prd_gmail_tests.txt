PROJECT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT: Gmail Service Test Suite Enhancement

OBJECTIVE:
Complete the Gmail service test suite fixes to achieve 90%+ test pass rate and improve overall code coverage. Currently at 73% pass rate (19/26 tests passing) with 7 failures requiring resolution.

CURRENT STATE:
- Gmail service test file: tests/services/gmail/test_gmail_service_focused.py
- Tests passing: 19/26 (73%)
- Database schema issues: RESOLVED (switched from temp_db to simple_db fixture)
- Remaining failures: 7 tests in incremental sync, empty message handling, and partial failures

REQUIREMENTS:

1. FIX INCREMENTAL SYNC TESTS
- test_sync_incremental_with_history: Fix History API mock to use get_history() not get_history_since()
- test_sync_incremental_fallback_to_full: Ensure proper fallback when no history available
- test_sync_incremental_history_api_failure: Handle History API failures gracefully
- Mock profile.get_profile() to return proper email and history_id
- Mock storage.get_sync_state() and update_sync_state() correctly

2. FIX EMPTY MESSAGE HANDLING
- test_sync_emails_empty_messages: Expects success=False with "CRITICAL FAILURE" for empty results
- This is intentional behavior to detect system issues
- Test should verify this behavior correctly

3. FIX FETCH AND SAVE OPERATIONS
- test_fetch_and_save_messages: Ensure proper account_email parameter passing
- test_fetch_and_save_partial_failures: Handle partial failures correctly
- Mock summarizer.extract_summary() appropriately

4. VERIFY STORAGE OPERATIONS
- test_get_emails_storage_failure: Should handle storage exceptions
- Ensure proper error propagation and handling

5. IMPROVE TEST COVERAGE
- Add missing edge case tests
- Ensure all API methods are tested
- Verify error handling paths

6. PROPERTY-BASED TESTING
- Enhance Hypothesis tests for robustness
- Add more property-based test scenarios
- Test with various input combinations

7. INTEGRATION TESTING
- Verify real database operations work correctly
- Test pipeline integration
- Test summarization integration

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All 26 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- No database schema errors
- Proper mock usage for external dependencies
- Clear test documentation
- Coverage improvement for Gmail service module

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Use existing test fixtures (simple_db, gmail_service_with_mocks)
- Follow project testing philosophy (test real functionality, avoid excessive mocks)
- Maintain test isolation
- Keep tests fast and reliable

DELIVERABLES:
- Fixed test_gmail_service_focused.py with all tests passing
- Updated mock configurations
- Test execution report showing 100% pass rate
- Coverage report showing improvement
