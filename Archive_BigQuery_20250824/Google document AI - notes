## **COPY-PASTE THESE EXACT COMMANDS TO CLAUDE CODE**

### **COMMAND 1: GET THE EMAILS**

```
Create a Python script called get_emails.py that:
1. Opens SQLite database at: /Users/jim/Projects/Litigator_solo/data/system_data/emails.db
2. Runs this EXACT query: SELECT date, sender, recipient, subject, body FROM emails WHERE subject LIKE '%Stoneman%' OR body LIKE '%Stoneman%' ORDER BY date
3. Writes results to a file called all_emails.txt with format: date | sender | recipient | subject | body
4. Print how many emails were found
5. Run the script immediately
```

### **COMMAND 2: GET THE PDFS AS TEXT**

```
Create a Python script called get_pdfs.py that:
1. Lists all PDF files in the current directory
2. For each PDF, use PyPDF2 or pdfplumber to extract text
3. Save each PDF's text to a file with same name but .txt extension
4. Combine all txt files into one file called all_pdfs.txt
5. Print how many PDFs were processed
6. Run the script immediately
```

### **COMMAND 3: COMBINE EVERYTHING**

```
Create a Python script called combine.py that:
1. Read all_emails.txt
2. Read all_pdfs.txt  
3. Combine them into one file called MASTER_DOCUMENT.txt
4. Add a header that says "EMAILS:" before emails and "DOCUMENTS:" before PDFs
5. Print the total word count and file size
6. Run the script immediately
```

### **COMMAND 4: SEND TO GEMINI**

```
Create a Python script called analyze.py that:
1. Install google-generativeai with pip if needed
2. Read MASTER_DOCUMENT.txt
3. Use API key: [paste your Gemini API key]
4. Send this exact prompt: "Analyze this legal case. Find: 1) Every threat or harassment with dates, 2) Every repair avoidance with excuses used, 3) Every identity concealment instance, 4) Evidence for restraining order. Give specific quotes and dates."
5. Save response to analysis_results.txt
6. Print the response
7. Run the script immediately
```

### **IF CLAUDE FUCKS UP ANY STEP:**

```
Debug the error and fix it. Do not ask me questions. Make it work. If a library is missing, install it. If a file path is wrong, find the right one. Just make it work and show me the results.
```

### **BACKUP IF CLAUDE IS STILL STUPID:**

```
Show me the exact terminal commands to:
1. Export SQLite data to CSV
2. Convert PDFs to text using any method that works
3. Combine files using cat command
4. Show me how to manually paste into Google AI Studio

Do not write complex code. Just give me terminal commands I can copy-paste.
```

**That's it. Copy each command block one at a time to Claude Code. Don't let it overthink.**
