Conidia dimensions: 18-83 x 7-18 microns. A very common allergen with an IgE mediated\nresponse. It is often found in carpets, textiles and on horizontal surfaces in building interiors. Often found\non window frames. Outdoors it may be isolated from samples of soil, seeds and plants. It is commonly\nfound in outdoor samples. The large spore size, 20 - 200 microns in length and 7 - 18 microns in sizes,\nsuggests that the spores from these fungi will be deposited in the nose, mouth and upper respiratory\ntract. It may be related to bakers' asthma. It has been associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis.I \nThe species Alternaria alternata can produce tenuazonic acid and other toxic metabolites that may be\nassociated with disease in humans or animals. Common cause of extrinsic asthma (immediate-type\nhypersensitivity: type I). Acute symptoms include edema and bronchospasms; chronic cases may\ndevelop pulmonary emphysema.\nAscospore\nA spore borne in a special cell called an ascus. Spores of this type are reported to be allergenic. All\nascomycetes, members of a group of fungi called Ascomycotina, have this type of spore. The minute\nblack dots on rotting wood and leaves or the little cups on lichens are examples of ascomycetes; another\nis the \"truffle\" mushroom.\nAspergillus/Penicillium\nThese are two of the most commonly found allergenic fungi in problem buildings. Aspergillus comes in\nmany varieties (species). Many of the varieties produce toxic substances. It may be associated with\nsymptoms such as sinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and other allergic symptoms.\nPenicillium is a variety of mold that is very common indoors and is found in increased numbers in\nproblem buildings. It also has many varieties, some of which produce toxic substances. The symptoms\nare allergic reactions, mucous membrane irritation, headaches, vomiting, and diarrhea. Due to the\nmorphological similarity of Aspergillus and Penicillium , they are not differentiated by microscopic\nanalysis and are reported together.\nAspergillus sp.\nAw 0.75 - 0.82. Reported to be allergenic. Members of this genus are reported to cause ear infections.\nMany species produce mycotoxins that may be associated with disease in humans and other animals.\nToxin production is dependent on the species or a strain within a species and on the food source for the\nfungus. Some of these toxins have been found to be carcinogenic in animal species. Several toxins are\nconsidered potential human carcinogens. Common cause of extrinsic asthma (immediate-type\nhypersensitivity: type I). Acute symptoms include edema and bronchospasms; chronic cases may\ndevelop pulmonary emphysema; may also be associated with sinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary\naspergillosis, and other allergic symptoms.\nDoc 16.0 Rev 2 12/27/19\nPage 5 of 14\nAureobasidium\nAureobasidium pullulans is a ubiquitous and generalistic black, yeast-like fungus that can be found in different\nenvironments (e.g., soil, water, air, and limestone). It is well known as a naturally occurring epiphyte or endophyte\nof a wide range of plant species (e.g. apple, grape, cucumber, green beans, cabbage) without causing any symptoms\nof disease. A. pullulans has a high importance in biotechnology for the production of different\nenzymes, siderophores and pullulan. Furthermore, A. pullulans is used in biological control of plant diseases,\nespecially storage diseases.\nChronic human exposure to A. pullulans via humidifiers or air conditioners can lead to\nhypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis) or \"humidifier lung\". This condition is characterized\nacutely by dyspnea, cough, fever, chest infiltrates, and acute inflammatory reaction. The condition can also be\nchronic, and lymphocyte mediated. The chronic condition is characterized radiographically by reticulonodular\ninfiltrates in the lung, with apical sparing. The strains causing infections in humans were reclassified to A.\nmelanogenum.\nBasidiospore\nSpore from basidiomycetes. Many varieties are reported to be allergenic.\nBipolaris sp.\nAw 0.93. Conidia dimensions: 7-14 x 5-9 microns. It is parasitic on plants and soft fruits. Found in soil\nand on house plants and vegetables, it is also known as \"gray mold\". It causes leaf rot on grapes,\nstrawberries, lettuce, etc. It is a well-known allergen, producing asthma type symptoms in greenhouse\nworkers and \"wine grower's lung\".\nBotrytis sp.\nA fungus with large spores that could be expected to be deposited in the upper respiratory tract. This\nfungus can produce the mycotoxin - sterigmatocystin, which has been shown to produce liver and kidney\ndamage when ingested by laboratory animals.\nCercaspora\nCommon outdoors in agricultural areas, especially during harvest. Parasite of higher plants, causing leaf\nspot. Commonly found as parasites on higher plants.\nChaetomium sp.\nLarge ascomycetous fungus producing perithecia. It is found on a variety of substrates containing\ncellulose, including paper and plant compost. It has been found on paper in sheetrock. It can produce an\nAcremonium- like state on fungal media. Varieties are considered allergenic and have been associated\nwith peritonitis, cutaneous lesions, and system mycosis.\nDoc 16.0 Rev 2 12/27/19\nPage 6 of 14\nCladosporium sp.\nAw 0.88; Aw 0.84. Most commonly identified outdoor fungus. The outdoor numbers are reduced in the\nwinter. The numbers are often high in the summer. Often found indoors in numbers less than outdoor\nnumbers. It is a common allergen. Indoor Cladosporium sp. may be different than the species identified\noutdoors. It is commonly found on the surface of fiberglass duct liners in the interior of supply ducts. A\nwide variety of plants are food sources for this fungus. It is found on dead plants, woody plants, food,\nstraw, soil, paint, and textiles. Produces greater than 10 antigens. Antigens in commercial extracts are of\nvariable quality and may degrade within weeks of preparation. Common cause of extrinsic asthma\n(immediate-type hypersensitivity: type I). Acute symptoms include skin lesions, eye ulceration, mycosis\n(including onychomycosis, an infection of the nails of the feet or hands) edema and bronchospasms;\nchronic cases may develop pulmonary emphysema.\nCurvularia sp.\nReported to be allergenic and has been associated with allergic fungal sinusitis. It may cause corneal\ninfections, mycetoma, and infections in immune compromised hosts.\nDreschlera sp.\nConidia dimensions: 40-120 x 17-28 microns. Found on grasses, grains and decaying food. It can\noccasionally cause a corneal infection of the eye.\nEpicoccum sp.\nConidia dimensions: 15-25 microns. A common allergen. It is found in plants, soil, grains, textiles and\npaper products.\nFusarium sp.\nAw 0.90. A common soil fungus. It is found on a wide range of plants. It is often found in humidifiers.\nSeveral species in this genus can produce potent trichothecene toxins. The trichothecene (scirpene)\ntoxin targets the following systems: circulatory, alimentary, skin, and nervous. Produces vomitoxin on\ngrains during unusually damp growing conditions. Symptoms may occur either through ingestion of\ncontaminated grains or possibly inhalation of spores. The genera can produce hemorrhagic syndrome in\nhumans (alimentary toxic aleukia). This is characterized by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dermatitis, and\nextensive internal bleeding. Reported to be allergenic. Frequently involved in eye, skin, and nail\ninfections.\nMyxomycetes\nMembers of a group of fungi that is included in the category of \"slime molds\". They're occasionally found\nindoors, but mainly reside in forested regions on decaying logs, stumps, and dead leaves. Myxomycetes\ndisplay characteristics of fungi and protozoans. In favorable (wet) conditions they exhibit motile, amoeba-\nlike cells, usually bounded only by a plasma membrane, that are variable in size and form. During dry\nspells, they form a resting body (sclerotium) with dry, airborne spores. These fungi are not known to\nproduce toxins but can cause hay fever and asthma.\nDoc 16.0 Rev 2 12/27/19\nPage 7 of 14\nMemnoniella\nContaminant found most often with Stachybotrys on wet cellulose. Forms in chains, but it are very similar\nto Stachybotrys and sometimes is considered to be in the Stachybotrys family. Certain species do produce\ntoxins very similar to the ones produced by Stachybotrys chartarum and many consider the IAQ\nimportance of Memnoniella to be on par with Stachybotrys. Allergenic and infectious properties are not\nwell studied.\nNigrospora sp.\nCommonly found in warm climates, this mold may be responsible for allergic reactions\nsuch as hay fever and asthma. It is found on decaying plant material and in the soil. It is\nnot often found indoors.\nOidium sp.\nThe asexual phase of Erysiphe sp. It is a plant pathogen causing powdery mildews. It is very common on\nthe leaf\u2019s stems, and flowers of plants. The health effects and allergenicity have not been studied. It\ndoes not grow on non-living surfaces such as wood or drywall.\nPenicillium sp.\nAw 0.78 - 0.88. A wide number of organisms have been placed in this genus. Identification to species is\ndifficult. Often found in aerosol samples. Commonly found in soil, food, cellulose and grains. It is also\nfound in paint and compost piles. It may cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic alveolitis in\nsusceptible individuals. It is reported to be allergenic (skin). It is commonly found in carpet, wallpaper,\nand in interior fiberglass duct insulation. Some species can produce mycotoxins. Common cause of\nextrinsic asthma (immediate-type hypersensitivity: type I). Acute symptoms include edema and\nbronchospasms; chronic cases may develop pulmonary emphysema. It may also cause headaches,\nvomiting, and diarrhea.\nPericonia sp.\nPericonia sp. are found in soil, blackened and dead herbaceous stems leaf spots, grasses, rushes, and\nsedges. Almost always associated with other fungi. Rarely found growing indoors. Reportedly associated\nwith a rare case of mycotic keratitis.\nPithomyces sp.\nA common mold found on dead leaves, plants, soil and especially grasses. Causes facial eczema in\nruminants. It exhibits distinctive multi-celled brown conidia. It is not known to be a human allergen or\npathogen. It is rarely found indoors, although it can grow on paper.\nDoc 16.0 Rev 2 12/27/19\nPage 8 of 14\nRusts/Smuts\nThese fungi are associated with plant diseases. In the classification scheme of the fungi, the smuts have\nmuch in common with the rusts, and they are frequently discussed together. Both groups produce wind-\nborne, resistant teliospores that serve as the basis for their classification and their means of spread.\nRusts usually attack vegetative regions (i.e., leaves and stems) of plants; smuts usually are associated\nwith the reproductive structures (seeds). They can cause hay fever and asthma.\nSpegazzinia\nSpegazzinia species comprise a very small proportion of the fungal biota. This genus is somewhat related\nto other lobed or ornamented genera such as Candelabrum . No information is available regarding health\neffects or toxicity. Allergenicity has not been studied. Usually identified on spore trap samples where it is\nseen every few weeks. (Spores have very distinctive morphology.) May also be found in air by culturable\n(Andersen) samples if a long enough incubation period is provided so that sporulation occurs. Our\nlaboratory has never found this organism growing on indoor environmental surfaces. Natural habitat\nincludes soil and many kinds of trees and plants.\nSporotrichum\nSporotrichum species comprise a very small proportion of the fungal biota and are most closely related to other\ncolorless hyphomycetes such as Chrysosporium. The only information available regarding health effects are a few\nrare cases of repeated isolations from respiratory secretions suggestive of bronchopulmonary colonization. No\ninformation is available regarding toxicity. Allergenicity has not been studied. May be identified on surfaces by\ntape lifts, tease mounts from bulk samples, and in air by culturable (Andersen) samples. Many times sporulating\ncolorless fungi are very difficult to identify, with critical structures only very faintly visible under oil immersion\nmagnification. Thus, these isolates may be placed in the\ncategory \"Colorless, sporulating, ID unknown\" on the\nAndersen report format. Spores do not have distinctive morphology and would be categorized as \"other colorless\"\non spore trap samples. Natural habitat includes soil and decaying wood.\nStachybotrys sp.\nAw - 0.94, optimum Aw ->0.98. Several strains of this fungus (S. atra, S. chartarum and\nS. alternans are synonymous) may produce a trichothecene mycotoxin- Satratoxin H - which is poisonous\nby inhalation. The toxins are present on the fungal spores. This is a slow growing fungus on media. It\ndoes not compete well with other rapidly growing fungi. The dark colored fungus grows on building\nmaterial with high cellulose content and low nitrogen content. Areas with a relative humidity above 55%,\nand are subject to temperature fluctuations, are ideal for toxin production. Individuals with chronic\nexposure to the toxin produced by this fungus reported cold and flu symptoms, sore throats, diarrhea,\nheadaches, fatigue, dermatitis, intermittent local hair loss and generalized malaise. Other symptoms\ninclude coughs, rhinitis, nosebleed, a burning sensation in the nasal passages, throat, and lungs, and\nfever. The toxins produced by this fungus will suppress the immune system affecting the lymphoid tissue\nand the bone marrow. Animals injected with the toxin from this fungus exhibited the following symptoms:\nnecrosis and hemorrhage within the brain, thymus, spleen, intestine, lung, heart, lymph node, liver, and\nkidney. Affects by absorption of the toxin in the human lung are known as pneumomycosis.\nDoc 16.0 Rev 2 12/27/19\nPage 9 of 14\nThis organism is rarely found in outdoor samples. It is usually difficult to find in indoor air samples\nunless it is physically disturbed (or possibly -this is speculation- a drop in the relative humidity). The\nspores are in a gelatinous mass. Appropriate media for the growth of this organism will have high\ncellulose content and low nitrogen content. The spores will die readily after release. The dead spores are\nstill allergenic and toxigenic. Percutaneous absorption has caused mild symptoms.\nStemphylium sp.\nReported to be allergenic. Isolated from dead plants and cellulose materials.\nTorula sp.\nFound outdoors in air, soil, on dead vegetation, wood, and grasses. Also found indoors on cellulose\nmaterials. Reported to be allergenic and may cause hay fever and asthma.\nTetraploa\nTetraploa species comprise a very small proportion of the fungal biota. This genus is somewhat related\nto Triposporium and Diplocladiella. The only reported human infections are two cases of keratitis (1970,\n1980) and one case of subcutaneous infection of the knee (1990). No information is available regarding\nother health effects or toxicity. Allergenicity has not been studied. Usually identified on spore trap\nsamples where it is seen every few weeks. (Spores have very distinctive morphology.) Our laboratory\nhas never found this organism growing on indoor environmental surfaces. Natural habitat includes leaf\nbases and stems just above the soil on many kinds of plants and trees.\nUlocladium sp.\nAw 0.89. Isolated from dead plants and cellulose materials. Found on textiles.\nZygomycetes\nZygomycetes are one of the four major groups of fungi, the others being the Oomycetes, the\nAscomycetes, and the Basidiomycetes. Zygomycetes are common, fast growing, and often overgrow\nand/or inhibit other fungi nearby. Rhizopus and Mucor are two of the most common Zygomycetes seen\nin the indoor environment. However, others are seen as well, including Syncephalastrum , Circinella\nMortierella , Mycotypha , Cunninghamella , and Choanephora .

Chemicals are released when IgE on certain cells contact an allergen. These chemicals can\ncause injury to surrounding tissue - the visible signs of an allergy. Only a few fungal allergens have been\ncharacterized but all fungi are thought to be potentially allergenic. Fungal allergens are proteins found in\neither the mycelium or spores\n\"Black mold\"\nA poorly defined term. Black mold or toxic black mold has usually been associated with the mold\nStachybotrys chartarum . While there are only a few molds that are truly black, there are many that can\nappear black. Not all molds that appear to be black are Stachybotrys .\nFungi\nFungi are neither animals nor plants and are classified in a kingdom of their own. The Kingdom of Fungi.\nFungi include a very large group of organisms, including molds, yeasts, mushrooms and puffballs. There\nare >100,000 accepted fungal species but current estimates range to 1.5 million species. Mycologists\n(people who study fungi) have grouped fungi into four large groups according to their method of\nreproduction.\nHidden mold\nThis refers to visible mold growth on building structures that is not easily seen, including the areas above\ndrop ceilings, within a wall cavity (the space between the inner and outer structure of a wall), inside air\nhandlers, or within the ducting of a heating/ventilation system.\nMicrobial Volatile Organic Compounds (MVOCs)\nFungi produce chemicals as a result of their metabolism. Some of these chemicals, MVOCs, are\nresponsible for the characteristic moldy, musty, or earthy smell of fungi, whether mushrooms or molds.\nSome MVOCs are considered offensive or annoying. Specific MVOCs are thought to be characteristic of\nwood rot and mold growth on building materials. The human nose is very sensitive to mold odors and\nsometimes more so than current analytical instruments.\nMold\nMolds are a group of organisms that belong to the Kingdom of Fungi (see Fungi). Even though the terms\nmold and fungi had been commonly referred to interchangeably, all molds are fungi, but not all fungi are\nmolds.\nDoc 16.0 Rev 2 12/27/19\nPage 13 of 14\nMycotoxin\nMycotoxins are compounds produced by some fungi that are toxic to humans or animals. By convention,\nthe term? Mycotoxin. Excludes mushroom toxins. Fungi that produce mycotoxins are called \"toxigenic\nfungi.\u201d\nSpore\nGeneral term for a reproductive structure in fungi, bacteria and some plants. In fungi, the spore is the\nstructure which may be used for dissemination and may be resistant to adverse environmental\nconditions.\nToxic mold\nThe term \"toxic mold\" has no scientific meaning since the mold itself is not toxic. The metabolic\nbyproducts of some molds may be toxic (see mycotoxin).\nHypha (plural, hyphae)\nAn individual fungal thread or filament of connected cells; the thread that represents the individual parts\nof the fungal body.\nDoc 16.0 Rev 2 12/27/19\nPage 14 of 14\n",
