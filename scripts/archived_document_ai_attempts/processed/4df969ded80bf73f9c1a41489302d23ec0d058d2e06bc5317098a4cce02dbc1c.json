(Ojavan Investors, Inc. v. California Coastal\nCom. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 373, 384 fn. 8.)\nA demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings. (Comm. on Children's Television,\nInc. v. Gen. Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 213.) A demurrer is proper when \"the pleading\ndoes not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\" (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\n430.10(e).) A demurrer is also proper when the pleading is uncertain, which the code describes\nas ambiguous and unintelligible. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 430.10(f).)\nA pleading, on its face, must contain sufficiently plead facts to support a cause of action,\nand the legal and factual conclusions of a pleader must be disregarded. (See Gruenberg v.\nAetna Ins. Co. , (1973) 9 Cal.3d 566, 572; Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co ., (1985)\n166 Cal.App.3d 452 [demurrer sustained when complaint failed to allege essential facts for\nany of the causes of action); Ankeny v. Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d\n531, 537 [a \u201cpleading must allege facts and not conclusions,\u201d and \u201cthe essential facts upon\nwhich a determination of the controversy depends should be stated with clearness and\nprecision so that nothing is left to surmise\u201d].) Furthermore, a material defect in a pleading\ncannot be overlooked. (See Wilhelm v. Pray, Price, Williams & Russell (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d\n1324, 1331-32.)\nA demurrer for uncertainty will only be sustained where the complaint is so poorly\npled that a defendant cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied,\nor what counts or claims are directed against him or her Khoury v. Maly\u2019s of California, Inc.\n(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.\nB.\n.\nDeficiencies in the Complaint as Grounds for Demurrer\nIt appears that all causes of action are alleged against Defendant. The complaint does\nnot specify. As the property manager for a period of approximately two months, these\ncauses of action are not properly alleged against Defendant.\nEven assuming that everything in the complaint is true (which all Defendants dispute),\nthere is insufficient facts to maintain the tortuous breach of warranty of habitability; breach\nof the covenant of quiet enjoyment; nuisance; business & professions Code section 17200 et\nseq; negligence; breach of contract; and declaratory relief causes of action against\nDefendant.\nPut another way, Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute any\ncause of action against Defendant. (CCP \u00a7 430.10(e).) Allegations surrounding the actions of\nthe Defendant do not begin until paragraph 30 of the complaint, where it states that\nPlaintiffs were informed that the Defendant would be managing the property effective\nSeptember 5, 2024. (See Complaint, \u00b630.) The management of the property ceased on\nNovember 30, 2024.\nThere are no facts indicating that Defendant\u2019s actions were negligent, or caused any\nbreach of the warranty of habitability or quiet enjoyment. Furthermore, as the property\nmanager, it is entirely unclear how the \u201cbusiness & professions code section 17200 et seq\u201d\nand \u201cdeclaratory relief\u201d causes of action can apply to Defendant. Indeed, the declaratory\nMK\nMANNING KASS\nJoseph Kellener\nJuly 25, 2025\nPage 3\nrelief cause of action refers to an addendum in the lease agreement that does not even\nexist.\nC. Grounds for Motion to Strike\nCross-Defendants\u2019 claims for punitive damages fail as a matter of law. California Civil\nCode section 3294(a) allows for the recovery of punitive damages only where plaintiffs\nestablish by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant acted with malice, oppression,\nor fraud in connection with tortious conduct at issue. At the pleading state, plaintiffs must\ndemonstrate specific facts demonstrating clear circumstances of malice, oppression, or fraud\nin order to be entitled to this relief. ( Grieves v. Sup. Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166-\n167; see also Cyrus v. Haveson (1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 306, 316-317 (to support a punitive\ndamage claim, a complaint must allege ultimate facts of a defendant\u2019s conduct.) When a\ncomplaint fails to include sufficient specific factual allegations to support a claim for punitive\ndamages, a motion to strike such claims should be granted. ( Id . at 159; see also Henderson\nv. Security National Bank ( 1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 764, 771 (stating that punitive damages\nshould only be allowed in the \u201cclearest of cases.\u201d) A \u201cconclusory characterization of\ndefendant\u2019s conduct as intentional, willful and fraudulent is a patently insufficient statement\nof \u2018oppression, fraud, malice, express or implied,\u2019 within the meaning of section 3294.\u201d\n( Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.)\nHere, the complaint fails to assert any specific facts showing such punitive behavior\non behalf of Defendant. It lacks any specific factual assertions showing that Defendant acted\nwith oppression, fraud, or malice. Indeed, there are only a few sentences in the entire\ncomplaint that even mention Defendant at all.\nThe Complaint does not include ultimate facts needed to support instances of malice,\noppression, or fraud. Instead, the Complaint contains generic allegations that purportedly\napply to Defendant (and all Defendants) without further specificity as to who did what and\nwhen. As established in the Grieves decision, \u201cat the pleading state, plaintiffs must\ndemonstrate specific facts demonstrating clear circumstances of malice, oppression, or\nfraud, in order to be entitled to this relief.\u201d Grieves, supra 157 Cal.App.3d at 166-167.\n,\nTherefore, the Complaint falls short of the necessarily high standard for punitive\ndamages. Defendant will seek removal of the request for punitive damages via a motion to\nstrike.\nD.\nConclusion\nPlease advise if you are willing to amend the Complaint in light of the above\nconsiderations. If we do not hear from your office, then we will proceed with filing the\ndemurrer and motion to strike on behalf of Defendant. Should you wish to discuss this\nfurther, please do not hesitate to contact our office with any questions.\nVery truly yours,\nMANNING\u2502KASS\nShanna Van Wagner, Esq.\nPartner\ncc:\nLane E.
