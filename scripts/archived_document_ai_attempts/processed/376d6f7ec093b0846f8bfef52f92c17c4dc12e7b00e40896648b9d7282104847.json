Respondents stated that on or around May 22nd\nthey went for scheduled site visit to address some repairs. Respondents stated that on\nthat visit they discovered that the glass shower enclosure from the upstairs bathroom\nhad been removed without permission causing damage to the downstairs ceiling.\nRespondents stated that at that time they requested that you make no further changes\nto the property without prior approval of the owners. Respondents stated that you\nresponded to this by telling them that you were just \u201cwaiting until the end of the lease to\nmove out\u201d and that you \u201cwould not be friendly going forward.\u201d Respondents stated that\non May 30th they went to repair a leaky toilet on the property where it was discovered\nthat a bidet was installed without approval. Respondents stated that they decided at this\ntime not to renew the lease and began to work on the 90-day notice. Respondents\nstated that they arranged a contractor to come and work on repairs at the property\nbeginning June 17th and received confirmation from you that that would be fine.\nRespondents stated that when they and the contractor showed up to begin the work,\nthey discovered a large dog on the property that they did not have any previous\nknowledge of. Respondents stated that they contacted you to ask about the dog and\nrearrange the start of the repairs as the dog could not be on the property. Respondents\nstated that you responded to them that the dog was your emotional support animal, but\nyou did not submit any request for this animal previously or during this exchange.\nRespondents stated that on June 19th, they emailed you a letter of non-renewal of the\nlease, a lease violation for an animal on premises without seeking accommodation and\nunapproved repairs, alterations or improvements as well as a 90-day notice which was\nCRD-ENF 25HCD (Revised 2025/04)\nClosure Determination and Request for Additional Information\nMay 23, 2025\nPage 3 of 4\nnot acknowledged by you at all. Respondents stated that they then mailed it to you\nwhich was delivered on July 15th. Respondents stated on August 5th they received a\nformal request for an emotional support animal in which they responded to let you know\nthat they were not extending the lease, but you could provide a medical letter if you\nwished to formalize the process. Respondents stated that a letter was submitted by you\nfrom your healthcare professional on August 12th. Respondents stated that they asked\nyou sign an animal terms and conditions addendum which was returned by you on\nAugust 21st. Respondents stated that they sent a confirmation of lease termination and\nnon-renewal of the lease, and an offer was provided if you needed more time to make\nplans. Respondents stated that you entered a month-to-month contract as of August\n30th.\nInvestigative Findings:\nDuring the investigation, the Department interviewed you, Respondents and reviewed\nall evidence in the casefile. The Department investigated the allegations that you were\ndenied a rental/sale/lease, denied a reasonable accommodation and denied equal\nterms and conditions due to your disability. A review of the evidence you submitted\nincluded an email notification from June 19, 2024, of lease violations and the non-\nrenewal of your lease. You also included the formal accommodation request for your\nemotional support animal on August 5, 2024. You submitted an email from the\nRespondents dated August 13, 2024, that confirmed your request and asked for a lease\naddendum to be completed. Evidence also shows that the Respondents withdrew the\nnon-renewal and transitioned your tenancy to a month-to-month lease which you agreed\nto on or around August 30, 2024. Respondents submitted evidence to support their\ndefense including a text message from June 17, 2024, where the respondents asked\nabout a dog that was discovered on the property during repairs. Respondents also\nincluded a copy of your signed lease agreement which included clause 13 stating no\nanimals were allowed on the property without prior permission of the property owners.\nRespondents submitted a copy of your reasonable accommodation request from August\n5, 2024, and doctors note date August 1, 2023. Respondents confirmed that the notice\nof lease violation was regarding not only the unauthorized animal, but other issues such\nas alterations to the subject property without prior approval. Evidence shows that the\nemotional support animal was never denied or removed from the subject property, and\nyou remain in the unit as of the date of this letter. The Department attempted to validate\nboth your disability and associated needs with your practitioner, but you declined to sign\nthe medical release allowing the Department to do that. Based on the evidence in file,\nthere is insufficient evidence to show that you were denied a rental/sale/lease, denied a\nreasonable accommodation and denied equal terms and conditions due to your\ndisability.\nThe new information that you provide will be carefully considered. If you do not provide\nmore information which substantiates your allegations within ten (10) calendar days,\nJune 3, 2025, your complaint will be closed, and you may file a private lawsuit.\nCRD-ENF 25HCD (Revised 2025/04)\nClosure Determination and Request for Additional Information\nMay 23, 2025\nPage 4 of 4\nYou can provide the information by telephone, mail, or e-mail. If you choose to mail your\nresponse, please include your case number 202409-26239516 and mail it to the Civil\nRights Department, 651 Bannon Street, Suite 200, Sacramento, CA 95811\nSincerely,\nLauren Witham\nLauren Witham\nAssociate Governmental Program Analyst\n916-964-1988\nlauren.witham@calcivilrights.ca.gov\nCRD-ENF 25HCD (Revised 2025/04)\n",
