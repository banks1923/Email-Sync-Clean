INTRODUCTION\nThis case is a habitability matter. Plaintiffs JAMES BURBANK and JENNIFER\nBURBANK (hereinafter referred to as \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) allege that their rented condominium unit was\n5 uninhabitable and caused them injuries. Plaintiffs filed their complaint for damages on November\n6\n7\n25, 2024. The Complaint consists of seven causes of action for: (1) tortious breach of warranty of\nhabitability; (2) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; (3) nuisance; (4) Business &\n8 Professions Code \u00a7 17200 et seq.; (5) negligence; (6) breach of contract; and (7) declaratory relief.\n9\n10\n11\nThe named Defendants are the owners and a short-term property management company.\nHere, the Complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendant,\neither directly or by reasonable inference. Defendant LOTUS PROPERTY SERVICES, INC. only\n12 served as the property manager for less than three months.\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\nDefendant demurs to all seven causes of action of Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint on the grounds that\nno cause of action states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the Defendant.\nII. MEET AND CONFER EFFORTS PRIOR TO FILING MOTION\nOn July 23, 2025, Defendant\u2019s counsel filed a Notice of Inability to Meet and Confer with\ncounsel, which provided a thirty-day extension of time to respond to Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.\n(Declaration of Shanna M. Van Wagner, (\u201cSMV Decl.\u201d), \u00b6 3.)\nOn July 25, 2025, Defendant\u2019s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\n20 which outlined the intended demurer on the grounds that the Complaint failed to allege any facts\n21 sufficient to sustain the causes of action against Defendant. (SMV Decl., \u00b6 4.) Additionally, this\ncorrespondence outlined the intended motion to strike on the grounds that the Complaint fails to\nallege any ultimate or specific facts to sustain the claim for punitive damages. (Id.)\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\nOn July 31, 2025, a representative from Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel informed us that the letter was\n\u201cunder review.\u201d (SMV Decl., \u00b6 5.)\nOn August 19, 2025, Defendant\u2019s counsel requested a response to whether Plaintiffs would\n27 amend their Complaint. (Id.) To date, Defendant\u2019s counsel received no response. (Id.)\n28\n5\nDEFENDANT\u2019S NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COMPLAINT;\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nIII. LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER\nA party against whom a complaint has been filed may object by demurrer on grounds that\nthe pleading \u201cdoes not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.\n\u00a7 430.10(e).) A demurrer \u201cmay be taken to the whole complaint . . . or to any of the causes of action\nstated therein.\u201d (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 430.50(a).) California courts hold that \u201c[a] general\n6 demurrer is concerned with the question of whether the facts pleaded constitute a cause of action,\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\nand is properly sustained only in those instances where no cause of action at all is shown by the\ncomplaint.\u201d (Los Angeles County v. Read (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 748, 751 (internal citations\nomitted); see Ojavan Investors, Inc. v. California Coastal Com. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 373, 384 n.8\n(noting general demurrer \u201cpoints out substantive pleading defects such as failure to state a cause of\naction or affirmative defenses\u201d).)\nA demurrer is properly based on the complaint itself, as well as upon matters of which the\nCourt is required to or may take judicial notice. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 430.30(a).) The court\nassessing a general demurrer accepts as true the \u201cmaterial facts properly pleaded\u201d in the complaint,\n15 but rejects \u201ccontentions, deductions[,] or conclusions of fact or law.\u201d (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39\n16 Cal.3d 311, 318 (internal citations omitted); George v. Automobile Club of Southern Cal. (2011)\n17 201 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1120 (noting that whereas a demurrer \u201cadmits all facts properly pleaded, [it\ndoes] not [admit] contentions, deductions[,] or conclusions of law or fact\u201d).)\n18\n19\n20\nIn ruling upon a general demurrer, \u201ceffect must be given to every allegation in the\ncomplaint; and the demurrer must be overruled if the complaint states, or from its averments it can\n21 be reasonably inferred, that plaintiff has a cause of action against defendant on any theory.\u201d (Beason\n22\nv. Griff (1954) 127 Cal.App.2d 382, 386\u201387 (internal citations omitted). Additionally, it is a well-\n23 established rule that \u201calthough a general demurrer must be sustained if the complaint fails to state a\n24\n25\ncause of action, it shall not be sustained without leave to amend if it is subject to amendment to state\na cause of action . . . .\u201d (Mull v. Hunter (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 657, 659 (internal quotations and\n26 citations omitted).)\n27 IV. PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE SUFFICIENT FACTS\n28\nIn evaluating a demurrer, the court assumes the truth of all material facts which have been\n6\nDEFENDANT\u2019S NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COMPLAINT;\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES\n1\n2\nproperly pleaded, of facts which may be inferred from those expressly pleaded, and of any material\nfacts of which judicial notice has been requested and may be taken. (Crowley v. Katleman (1994) 8\n3 Cal.4th 666, 672.) A demurrer does not admit contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.||\n4\n5\n6\n7\n(Dear v. Yellow Cab Company (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695. Further, the complaint allegations must be\nsupported by \u201cultimate facts,\u201d not legal conclusions. (Burke v. Superior Court (1969) 71 Cal.2d\n276.)\nThis demurrer should be sustained to all causes of action, as Plaintiffs have failed to allege\n8 sufficient ultimate facts to state claims for those causes of action.\n9\n10\n11\nA.\nPlaintiffs Fail to State Facts Sufficient to Support the First Cause of Action for\nTortuous [sic] Breach of Warranty of Habitability\nThe elements of a cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability \u201care the\n12 existence of a material defective condition affecting the premises' habitability, notice to the landlord\n13\n14\nof the condition within a reasonable time after the tenant's discovery of the condition, the landlord\nwas given a reasonable time to correct the deficiency, and resulting damages.\u201d (Erlach v. Sierra\n15 Asset Servicing, LLC (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1297.)\n16\n18\nDefendant managed the property for less than three months. The key term is whether the\n17 defective is material. In Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint, they note that an inspector from the Los Angeles\nDepartment of Public Health came to the unit to conduct an inspection. According to the Complaint,\n19 the inspector \u201cfound peeling paint on the windowsill in the living room.\u201d (Complaint, \u00b6 51.) Peeling\npaint does not rise to the level of a material condition that impacts the habitability of the premises.\n20\n21\n22\nThe Complaint then alleges that the Defendant (which one?) is an experienced property\nowner and manager of residential property throughout Los Angeles County and is aware that\n23 construction done without permits and inspections\u2026\u201d There is no construction referred to in the rest\n24\nof the Complaint. Paragraphs 77 through 82 contain conclusory statements void of factual support.\n25 Notably, these paragraphs refer to a single Defendant. There are seven (7) Defendants named in\n26 the Complaint.\n27\nAs such, there are insufficient facts sufficient to sustain this cause of action against\n28 Defendant.\n7\nDEFENDANT\u2019S NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COMPLAINT;\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES\n1\nB.\n2\n3\nPlaintiffs Fail to State Facts Sufficient to Support the Second Cause of Action\nfor Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment\nMinor inconveniences typically do not qualify as breaches. The landlord\u2019s actions must\n4 substantially interfere with the ability to enjoy the property. As noted above, the Complaint varies\n5 between reference to a single, unnamed Defendant, and Defendants without specification.\n6\nFurthermore, as noted in the Complaint, Plaintiffs then explicitly state that the Leasing Defendant\n7 breached the implied warranty of habitability (Complaint, \u00b6 51.) As Defendant was not the Leasing|| \n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\nDefendant, this cause of action fails to state sufficient facts as to the moving Defendant.\nC.\nPlaintiffs Fail to State Facts Sufficient to Support the Third Cause of Action for\nNuisance and the Fifth Cause of Action for Negligence\nWhere negligence and nuisance causes of action rely on the same facts about lack of due\ncare, the nuisance claim is a negligence claim. (City of San Diego v. U.S. Gypsum Co., supra, 30\nCal.App.4th at p. 587; Martinez v. Pacific Bell (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1557, 1565; [\u201cwhere the\nalleged nuisance is the result of the defendant's alleged negligent conduct, rules of negligence are\napplied\u201d].))\nA cause of action alleging a continuing nuisance is usually accompanied by a request for an\ninjunction. (El Escorial Owners' Assn. v. DLC Plastering, Inc., (2007) 154 Cal. App. 4th 1337,\n1349, as modified on denial of reh'g (Oct. 3, 2007). )\nIn Escorial, Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for nuisance incorporated the same facts as the cause\nof action for negligence. The trial court reasonably found that Escorial's nuisance cause of action\nwas merely a clone of the first cause of action using a different label. Van Zyl v. Spiegelberg (1969)\n2 Cal.App.3d 367, 372\u2013373; see also Atherton Condominium Apartment\u2013Owners Assn. Bd. of\n23 Directors v. Blume Development Co., , 115 Wash.2d 506, 527, 799 P.2d 250, 263 [in construction\n24 defect case \u201ca \u2018negligence claim presented in the garb of nuisance\u2019 need not be considered apart\n25 from the negligence claim\u201d].) \u201c \u2018... \u201cThe torts of negligence and nuisance ... frequently are,\n26 coexisting and practically inseparable.... A nuisance in many, if not in most, instances, especially\n27 with respect to buildings or premises, presupposes negligence.\u201d...\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d Lussier v. San\n28 Lorenzo Valley Water Dist., supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p. 104.)\n8\nDEFENDANT\u2019S NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COMPLAINT;\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nParalleling what the Court faced in Escorial, Plaintiffs\u2019 Nuisance claim does not include a\nrequest for an injunction. The claim incorporates all the same alleged facts for Negligence. It is\nduplicative, seeks no unique damages, and provides no unique remedies. Furthermore, both causes\nof action contain sweeping conclusions as to the conduct of unspecified Defendants. As such, the\ndemurrer as to these causes of action must be sustained.\nD.\nPlaintiffs Fail to State Facts Sufficient to Support the Fourth Cause of Action\nfor Business & Professions Code \u00a7 17200 et seq.\n1.\nPlaintiffs Fail to Plead Injury in Fact\nBusiness and Professions Code sections 17200 et seq. (commonly referred to as Unfair\nCompetition Law, which is \u201cUCL\u201d hereinafter) provides for \u201climited remedies\u201d in a private action.\nKorea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1152. Indeed, an action\n12 under the UCL is equitable in nature; damages and penalties cannot be recovered in a private\n13 action. (Id. at 1444; 1150.) Rather, private plaintiff's potential remedies under UCL are limited to\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\ninjunctive relief and restitution. Here, Plaintiffs seek restitution, however, the property manager\nwould not owe restitution to the Plaintiffs.\nSection 17204 provides that a private person has standing to sue only if he \u201chas suffered\ninjury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.\u201d (Daro v. Sup.\nCt. (James Foy) (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1097.) California Appellate courts require that a\nprivate plaintiff under UCL show a distinct and palpable injury that is concrete. (Peterson v.\n20 Cellco Partnership (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1591.) In reaching such a conclusion and in an\n21\neffort to curb abuses of the UCL, the Cellco Partnership court reasoned that there must be an\n22 \u201cactual economic injury.\u201d (Id.)\nIn this case, plaintiffs fail to properly allege an actual economic injury. Rather, in vague\n23\n24 and general terms, plaintiffs allege that they sustained economic injury. Thus, plaintiffs\n25\n26\n27\n28\nadditionally fail to properly plead an injury in fact.\n2.\nPlaintiffs fail to properly allege conduct by Defendant that amounted to a\nviolation of the UCL.\nThe primary purpose of \u00a7 17200 is to protect consumers against \u201cunlawful,\u201d unfair\u201d or\n9\nDEFENDANT\u2019S NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COMPLAINT;\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES\n1 \u201cfraudulent\u201d business practices. (Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn. (1972) 7 Cal.3d 94,|| \n2\n111.) Unfair business practices are those which are immoral, unethical, oppressive or\n3\nunscrupulous. (State Farm v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 193, 1104.) As was stated in\n4 CelTech Communications Inc. v. LA Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 187, unfair\n5 business practices is \u201cconduct which threatens an incipient violation of an anti-trust law, or\n6 violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws, because its effects are comparable to or the same\n7\nas a violation of the law or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.\u201d\n8 \u201cPractice\u201d generally means the habitual doing of certain things, the doing of an act more than once\n9\n... or repeated or customary action.\u201d (Wilson v. Stearns (1954) 123 Cal.App.2d 472, 479.) It is a\n10 \u201cpattern of behavior pursued in the course of business.\u201d (People v. Casablanca Convalescent\nHome, Inc. (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 509, 527.)\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\nMoreover, the California courts routinely require a plaintiff alleging unfair business\npractices under the UCL to plead facts supporting the alleged UCL violation with reasonable\nparticularity. (Perdue v. Crocker National Bank (1985) 38 Cal.3d 913, 929; see, e.g., 5 Witkin,\nCal. Procedure (3rd ed. 1985) Pleading, \u00a7 728, p. 176.)\nIn Khoury v. Malys of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, the court explained:\n17 \u201c[The] demurrer was properly sustained ... because the ... complaint identifies no particular section\n18\nof the statutory scheme which was violated and fails to describe with any reasonable particularity\n19 the facts supporting the violation. The complaint refers to a \u2018effective misleading,\u2019 ... but the facts\n20\n21\n22\nclearly do not involve deceptive advertising (See, Business & Professions Code \u00a7 17200), [unfair\ncompetition includes deceptive or misleading advertising], 17500 et seq. [specific false advertising\npractices], nor do the facts explain the manner of misleading .... The complaint does not describe\n23 the manner in which respondent's practice is \u2018unlawful\u2019 ... the facts do not involve monopolistic or\nanti-competitive practice (See, Business & Professions Code \u00a7 17201), because appellant is not in\ncompetition with the respondent.\u201d Id. at 619 (emphasis added).\n24\n25\n26\nPlaintiffs' fifth cause of action for unfair business practices is deficient in all respects. First,\n27 Plaintiffs have not shown any business \u201cpractice\u201d on the part of Defendant which is subject to the\n28 statute. The allegations set forth in the Complaint clearly do not indicate a \u201cpattern of behavior,\u201d|| \n10\nDEFENDANT\u2019S NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COMPLAINT;\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES\n1\n2\n3\nmuch less from the moving Defendant.\nSection 17200, is violated if a business practice is unlawful or unfair or deceptive. (Cel\u2013\nTech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 180 (Cel\u2013\n4 Tech Communications ).) \u201c[A] practice is prohibited as \u2018unfair\u2019 or \u2018deceptive\u2019 even if not \u2018unlawful\u2019\n5\n6\nand vice versa.\u201d (State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1093,\n1102, disapproved on other grounds in Cel\u2013Tech Communications, supra, at p. 187, fn. 12.) To\n7 show a business practice is unfair, the plaintiff must show the conduct \u201cthreatens an incipient\n|| \n8\n9\n10\nviolation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects\nare comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms\ncompetition.\u201d (Cel\u2013Tech Communications, supra, at p. 186.)\n11\nE.\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\nPlaintiffs Fail to State Facts Sufficient to Support the Sixth Cause of Action\nfor Breach of Contract\nPlaintiffs do not allege any contract with Defendant. Further, this cause of action appears\nduplicative of the others. Thus, the demurrer on this cause of action should be sustained.\nF.\nPlaintiffs Fail to State Facts Sufficient to Support the Seventh Cause of Action\nfor Declaratory Relief\nNot only do Plaintiffs fail to state sufficient facts to support this cause of action, but it does\nnot make sense. Paragraph 116 refers to an addendum which was not attached to the Complaint. It\n19 is entirety unclear for what the Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief.\n20 / / /\n21\n/ / /\n22\n/ / /\n23\n/ / /\n24\n/ / /\n25\n/ / /\n26\n/ / /\n27 / / /\n28 / / /\n11\nDEFENDANT\u2019S NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COMPLAINT;\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES\n1\n2\n3\nV.
