Calhoun (Trustee), Lotus Property\nManagement, Brian Gordon, Sally Gutierrez, Grace Cheng.\n\u2022\nThe suit covers chronic mold, leaks, harassment, retaliation, and failure to fix\nsubstandard conditions.\n2.\n\u2022\nProc. \u00a71162).\n\u2022\nImproper 60-Day Notice\nNotice was \u201cnailed\u201d and not mailed, apparently violating service rules (Code Civ.\nLacks proper just cause under AB1482 (Tenant Protection Act), or if it purports a\n\u201cfamily move-in,\u201d no valid details/support provided.\n\u2022\nIf challenged in an Unlawful Detainer action, it\u2019s likely void. Landlords may have\nto reissue or correct the notice.\n3.\n\u2022\nRetaliation Argument\nThe timing strongly suggests retaliatory motive (Civ. Code \u00a71942.5).\n\u2022\nProtected tenant activities: requesting repairs, filing a lawsuit, cooperating with\nCRD.\n\u2022\nAny UD action within 6 months of these protected activities carries a presumption\nof retaliation, defeating eviction and allowing damages/penalties.\n4.\nMediation & Settlement\n\u2022\nCRD investigation ended; new round of mediation is pending.\n\u2022\nThe Burbanks proposed $150k; no counteroffer was made.\n\u2022\nPossible outcomes if mediation fails:\n\u2022\nProceed to trial on the existing lawsuit.\n\u2022\nPotential Unlawful Detainer action based on a corrected notice.\nclaims.\n\u2022\n5.\n\u2022\nSettlement typically involves relocation funds, rent abatement, and release of\nKeys to Strengthening the Tenant Case\nEvidence Preservation: Photos, videos, mold test results, city/health dept.\ncitations, repair logs, medical records showing health impact.\n\u2022\nDiscovery & Depositions: Obtain maintenance records, internal landlord\ncommunications, potential admissions of knowledge/neglect.\n\u2022\nExpert Witnesses: Mold experts, contractors, medical professionals to confirm\nhabitability violations and harm.\n\u2022\nRetaliation Proof: Maintain a clear timeline linking repair complaints, lawsuit filing,\nand the eviction threats.\n6. Practical Strategies\n\u2022\nContinue paying rent (if feasible) to avoid nonpayment at-fault eviction.\n\u2022\nDocument all landlord communications, especially regarding any refiled notices.\n\u2022\nConsider escrow of rent if severe habitability issues persist.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nStay open to settlement if the landlord eventually offers a fair sum.\nPrepare defenses and affirmative claims if a new UD is filed (lack of just cause,\nretaliatory eviction, habitability defenses).\n7.\n\u2022\nPotential Outcomes\nSuccessful Lawsuit: Monetary damages (rent abatement, emotional distress),\npossible punitive or statutory penalties, attorney\u2019s fees.\n\u2022\nFailed Negotiation: Litigation proceeds, culminating in a jury or bench trial.\n\u2022\nImproper Eviction Defense: Immediate dismissal of any UD based on defective\nnotice; landlord may attempt correct notice + AB1482 compliance.\n\u2022\nSettlement: Typically a buyout (\u201ccash for keys\u201d), waived rent, or other\ncompensation in exchange for move-out and dismissal of claims.\n8.\nRecommended Immediate Next Steps\n\u2022\nContinue preparing mold test results and evidence.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nMonitor any new or \u201ccorrected\u201d 60-day notice\u2014challenge it if noncompliant.\nMaintain strong communications with CRD mediator, remain open to settlement,\nbut hold firm on adequate compensation.\nUD.\n\u2022\nCoordinate closely with legal counsel to file necessary motions if landlord initiates\nOverall, the Burbanks possess robust legal leverage through AB1482 protections,\nanti-retaliation statutes, and substantial evidence of habitability violations. Their best approach\nis to remain consistent in paying rent (if possible), meticulously document all conditions and\ncommunications, and engage in any\nfurther mediation or legal procedures with well-organized\nproof of the landlord\u2019s breaches and retaliatory actions.\n",
