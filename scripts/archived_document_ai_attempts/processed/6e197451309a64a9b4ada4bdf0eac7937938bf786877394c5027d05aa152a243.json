MARTINEZ (\u201cResponding Party\u201d) hereby provides its response to\nJENNIFER BURBANK\u2019S (\u201cPropounding Party\u201d) Form Interrogatories-General (Set One) as\nfollows:\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThese responses are made only for the purpose of the within action. Each response or\nanswer is subject to all objections as to competence, relevance, materiality, propriety,\nadmissibility and any other objections and grounds that would require the exclusion of any\nstatement herein if any document was asked of, or if any statement contained therein were made\nby a witness present and testifying in court, all of which objections and grounds are reserved and\nmay be interposed at the time of trial.\nPlaintiff is responding to all Requests to the extent that information has become known\nby him. However, this responding party\u2019s discovery, investigation and preparation for trial of\nthis matter has not been completed as of the date of these responses, and, therefore, Plaintiff does\nnot purport to state anything more than information presently known and discovered by him.\nPlaintiff, in responding to these Requests, reserves the right to continue discovery and\ninvestigation in this matter for facts, witnesses and supporting data that may recall information\nwhich, if he had presently within his knowledge, would be included in these responses. For\nexample, to the extent that any request calls for the identification of \u2018all documents,\u201d it is\nresponded to fully insofar as information is presently available to Plaintiff, and Plaintiff is not\nprecluded from presenting at trial information discovered after the date of the response of this\nrequest.\nThis preliminary statement is incorporated into each of the responses set forth below.\nGENERAL OBJECTIONS\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\nTo avoid repetition in setting forth specific objections to interrogatories, responding party\nsets forth and incorporates the following objections to responding party\u2019s each and every\n27\nresponse.\nA. RELEVENCY OBJECTION\n28\nPLAINTIFF\u2019S RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES-GENERAL, SET ONE\n2\n1\n2\nResponding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory, in whole or in part, seek the\ndisclosure of information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of the action nor reasonably\ncalculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\n3\n4\nB. CONFIDENTIALITY/PRIVACY OBJECTION\n5\nResponding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory seeks the disclosure of\n6 confidential information and constitute an attempt to invade the personal and/or financial privacy|| \n7\nof certain individuals or persons.\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\nC. OVERBREADTH AND BURDEN OBJECTION\nResponding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is overbroad, burdensome and\noppressive in that they seek the disclosure of information that has little or no practical benefit to\npropounding party while placing an unwarranted burden or expense on the responding party in\nascertaining such information. Further, such interrogatory is so broadly drawn that although it\nmay include some relevant information within its scope, it includes information that is irrelevant\nor immaterial to the instant action. Such interrogatory seeks information which is cumulative\nand/or would require the compilation of extensive and detailed information from numerous\npotential sources, many of which is not easily identifiable or available. A search for all such\ninformation will in many instances involve enormous amounts of time by responding party.\nFurther, the interrogatory is so overbroad such that it is uncertain what information is sought.\nD. AMBIGUITY OBJECTION\nResponding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is phrased in language that is\nvague, ambiguous, and uncertain such that responding party is unable to ascertain what\ninformation is sought and in order to respond to this interrogatory, responding party would have\nto speculate as to propounding party\u2019s intended meaning.\nE. AVAILABILITY OBJECTION\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\nentities other than responding party.\nResponding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is equally accessible to all parties\nor is more accessible to the propounding party or which is maintained primarily by persons or\nPLAINTIFF\u2019S RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES-GENERAL, SET ONE\n3\n|| \n1\n2\n3\nF. IMPROPER FORM OBJECTION\nResponding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is phrased in improper form\nbecause the interrogatory is not \u201cfull and complete in and of itself\u201d; or because it contains\n4 subpart, \u201ccompound, conjunctive or disjunctive\u201d question, such that the interrogatory does not\n5\ncomply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a72030.060\n6\nG. LEGAL CONCLUSION OBJECTION\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nResponding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory calls for a legal conclusion.\nH. ATTORNEY WORK-PRODUCT OBJECTION\nResponding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory, in whole or in part,\nseeks disclosure of information that is protected under the attorney work-product doctrine.\nI. MARITAL PRIVILIGE OBJECTION\nResponding party objects on the basis that the request, in whole or in part, seek\ndisclosure of information that is protected under marital privilege.\nRESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES - GENERAL (SET ONE)\nFORM INTERROGATORY 1.1\nAnthony Marinaccio, Marinaccio Law, 225 W Broadway, Suite 103, Glendale, CA\n91204; (818) 839-52520.\nFORM INTERROGATORY 17.1\n(a) Request for Admission No. 1:\nResponding Party exercises its right to produce writings under Code of Civil Procedure\nSection 2030.210(a)(2).
