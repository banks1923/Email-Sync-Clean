The Court provides a free program to help landlords and tenants resolve their eviction caseonline without coming to Court. This voluntary program is called UD ODR (Unlawful Detainer OnlineDispute Resolution).Register here: https://my.lacourt.org/odr/unlawful-detainers
What is UD ODR?UD ODR is an online negotiation program for eviction cases. The program guides parties throughthe negotiation by asking simple questions about how they would like to resolve their case.If the parties reach an agreement, the program puts it into the proper form, each party "signs" itonline, and then the program sends it to the Court for review. If the Court approves the agreement, thetrial is cancelled, and no Court appearances are required.There is no risk: If parties try UD ODR but can't reach an agreement, they go to trial unless theycan resolve their case another way.
Free mediation: During UD ODR, parties can ask a mediator to help them use ODR or avideo conference to try to reach an agreement that may be better than going to trial. Free mediation isprovided by outside organizations, not by the Court.
