("Property").
The ability to communicate and conduct business electronically is a convenience and reality in nearly all parts of our lives.At the same time, it has provided hackers and scammers new opportunities for their criminal activity. Many businesseshave been victimized and the real estate business no exception.While wiring or electronically transferring funds is a welcome convenience, we all need to exercise extreme caution.Emails attempting to induce fraudulent wire transfers have been received and have appeared to be legitimate. Reportsindicate that some hackers have been able to intercept emailed transfer instructions, obtain account information and, byaltering some of the data, redirect the funds to a different account. It also appears that some hackers were able to providefalse phone numbers for verifying the wiring or funds transfer instructions. In those cases, the victim called the numberprovided to confirm the instructions, and then unwittingly authorized a transfer to somewhere or someone other than theintended recipient.ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE ADVISED:1. Obtain phone numbers and account numbers only from Escrow Officers, Property Managers, orLandlords at the beginning of the transaction.2. DO NOT EVER WIRE OR ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFER FUNDS PRIOR TO CALLING TOCONFIRM THE TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS. ONLY USE A PHONE NUMBER YOU WEREPROVIDED PREVIOUSLY. Do not use any different phone number or account number includedin any emailed transfer instructions.3. Oraily confirm the transfer instruction is legitimate and confirm the bank routing number,account numbers and other codes before taking steps to transfer the funds.4. Avoid sending personal information in emails or texts. Provide such information in person orover the telephone directly to the Escrow Officer, Property Manager, or Landlord.5. Take steps to secure the system you are using with your email account. These steps includecreating strong passwords, using secure WiFi, and not using free services.If you believe you have received questionable or suspicious wire or funds transfer instructions, immediately notify yourbank, and the other party, and the Escrow Office, Landlord, or Property Manager. The sources below, as well as others.can also provide information;Federal Bureau of Investigation: https://www.fbi.gov/; the FBI's IC3 at www.ic3.gov; or 310-477-6565National White Collar Crime Center: http://www.nw3c.org/On Guard Online: https://www.onguardonline.gov/NOTE: There are existing alternatives to electronic and wired fund transfers such as cashier's checks.By signing below, the undersigned acknowledge that each has read, understands and has received acopy of this Wire Fraud and Electronic Funds Transfer Advisory.Buyer/TenantJennifer BunkBuyer/TenantJames BurboutDate 9/4/23
