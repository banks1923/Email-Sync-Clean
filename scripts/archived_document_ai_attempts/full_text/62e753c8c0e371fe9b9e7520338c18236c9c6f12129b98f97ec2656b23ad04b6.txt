There are no special requirements for the disposal of moldy material. Moldy materials that are bagged can be
disposed of with other general waste.
All contaminated materials should be wrapped in plastic and sealed with tape before being taken out of the
containment area through the unaffected areas for disposal.
Sometimes building material, furniture, flooring, etc can not be evaluated until it has been jarred from its location.
For cases like this, the mold remediation company hired should be trusted to give an honest evaluation.
#8: Restoring a Damaged Item
If an item such as kitchen cabinets, clothing, furniture, etc were damaged you should have a yes/no answer to
whether or not your item can be restored
How this needs to be done is dependent upon the item in question. Wood may require sanding, clothes a simple
rinse in the wash, etc.
Some items like cabinets may appear to be salvaged, but after they are removed the damage is worse than our
inspector anticipated. Trust the mold professional you hire for advice on whether or not something can be restored.
#9: Final Cleaning
After the contaminated material has been removed, the contained area is to be HEPA vacuumed again.
If
any visual mold is seen on studs HEPA sand affected area.
In the event that an item cannot be restored it must be replaced, even if it is building material.
The contained area is to be wiped down with a biocide and/or detergent solution.
The contained area is to be HEPA vacuumed again.
#10: Air Scrubber(s)
Multiple air scrubbers should be used for properties with a widespread problem and no containment area. How
many
should be a decision trusted in the hands of the mold remediation company hired.
An Air Scrubber should be placed in each containment area for 48-72 hours.
#11 Air Duct Cleaning
Every mold remediation should be completed with a thorough cleaning of the HVAC system and air ducts.
Sanitize/Disinfect air handler coils.
Sanitize/Disinfect all duct work
#12: Final Inspections
Prior to containment removal and re-occupancy of the space a certified mold inspector should do a visual
inspection and air sampling. Air sample should be taken both within the containment and in an adjacent area to
insure spores have not spread to other areas.
After passing post remediation testing you may choose to apply a sealant around studs.
Containment removal and re-occupancy shall occur when space passes appropriate verification testing.
#13: Containment Used During Reconstruction
After the work area has passed clearance testing, the enclosure can be used to contain the dusts generated by
sheetrock sanding and taping activities. This is done to reduce the clean up when reconstruction is complete.
