Assessment Report #1 – Landing area of the stairwell leading to the garage
Assessed by: Saul Rosado (Flooring Contractor) and Brad Martinez
Assessment Result: There is a small air pocket under the laminate flooring in an area
approximately one square foot just outside the door leading to the garage. No structural
impairment detected.
Detail supporting assessment result:
1. Laminate Flooring is a Surface Layer
Laminate flooring is a cosmetic feature and does not contribute to the structural integrity of
a building. It functions as a protective and aesthetic covering for the subfloor, but any
issues with the laminate itself—such as air pockets—do not impact the foundation, walls,
or load-bearing elements of the structure.
2. Air Pockets are a Surface Defect
Air pockets are localized voids beneath the laminate, typically resulting from movement
due to temperature changes, installation errors, or subfloor irregularities. These pockets
are limited to the laminate layer and do not extend to or aect the underlying structural
components of the building.
3. No Evidence of Subfloor Damage
Temperature fluctuations may cause laminate planks to expand, contract, or shift, leading
to air pockets. However, unless there is direct evidence of moisture infiltration or structural
damage to the subfloor itself (e.g., warping, cracks), the issue remains superficial and
unrelated to the building's structure.
4. Impact is Limited to Flooring Performance
While air pockets may aect the look and feel of the flooring (e.g., uneven surface, noise
when stepped on), they do not compromise the safety or stability of the building. Resolving
the issue would involve repairing or replacing the laminate flooring, rather than addressing
any structural concerns.
In summary, air pockets under laminate flooring due to temperature fluctuations are purely
a surface-level issue. They may be inconvenient or unsightly but do not pose any threat to
the structural integrity of the property.
