follows:
Responding Party produces all relevant documents in Responding Party’s possession or
control which are attached hereto or sent concurrently with these responses. Discovery is
ongoing and it is anticipated that additional discovery and further investigation, legal research
and analysis will supply additional facts and provide new and different meaning to known facts,

additional changes and/or variations from the responses set herein and Responding Party reserves
the right to supplement this response at a later time as appropriate, up to and including at trial.

REQUEST NO. 18
All DOCUMENTS CONCERNING any legal advice or internal discussion about the
decision to terminate DEFENDANT'S TENANCY between January 1, 2025, and January 30,
2025.
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE TO REQUEST NO. 18
As part of this meet and confer process, Responding Party requests that Propounding Party
define the term “legal advice,” “internal discussions.” Because this request is compound,
Responding Party requests that Propounding Party separate this request into distinct asks.
Additionally, this request seeks confidential, private and/or privileged documents of third parties
not part of the Action, the disclosure of which would violate their right to privacy. This request
seeks information protected by disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product
doctrine and/or information prepared in anticipation of litigation, including physician-patient
privilege. Notwithstanding and without waiving the foregoing objections, Responding Party
responds as follows:
After a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry, Responding Party is unable to comply
with this request as propounded. Discovery is ongoing and it is anticipated that additional
discovery and further investigation, legal research and analysis will supply additional facts and
provide new and different meaning to known facts, and may establish new factual conclusions
and legal contentions, all of which may result in additional changes and/or variations from the
responses set herein and Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response at a
later time as appropriate, up to and including at trial.
