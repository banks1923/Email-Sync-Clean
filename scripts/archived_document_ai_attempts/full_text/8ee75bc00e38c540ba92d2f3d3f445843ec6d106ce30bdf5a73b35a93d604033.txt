Admit that PLAINTIFF had knowledge of DEFENDANT's written COMPLAINT to the
Los Angeles County Department of Public Health before serving the NOTICE.
RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 16
Responding Party objects to this request on the grounds that it is vague and ambiguous
regarding the term “knowledge.” Responding Party objects to this request on the grounds that it is
vague and ambiguous regarding the term “COMPLAINT” as the term is defined by Propounding
Party but used in this request. Responding Party objects to this request on the grounds that it is not
reasonably limited in scope or time, not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
or relevant evidence and it is compound, overbroad, burdensome, and oppressing and is only
designed to harass Responding Party. Notwithstanding and without waiving the foregoing
objections, Responding Party responds as follows:
Responding Party is unable to comply with this request as propounded. Responding Party
made a reasonable inquiry and the information it knows or can readily obtain is insufficient to
enable it to admit or deny. Discovery is ongoing and it is anticipated that additional discovery and
further investigation, legal research and analysis will supply additional facts and provide new and
different meaning to known facts, and may establish new factual conclusions and legal contentions,
all of which may result in additional changes and/or variations from the responses set herein and
Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response at a later time as appropriate, up
to and including at trial.
