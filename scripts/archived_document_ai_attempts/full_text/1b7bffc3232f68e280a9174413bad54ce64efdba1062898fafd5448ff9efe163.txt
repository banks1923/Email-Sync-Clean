inalienable right of privacy under the California Constitution and disclosure would violate
Responding Party and the third parties’ right to privacy. Subject to the foregoing objections, and
without waiving them, Responding Party responds as follows:
Responding Party exercises its right to produce writings under Code of Civil Procedure Section
2030.210(a)(2). Discovery is ongoing and it is anticipated that additional discovery and further
investigation, legal research and analysis will supply additional facts and provide new and different
meaning to known facts, and may establish new factual conclusions and legal contentions, all of
which may result in additional changes and/or variations from the responses set herein and
Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response at a later time as appropriate, up
to and including at trial.
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 13
State whether YOU were aware, at the time the NOTICE was served, that DEFENDANT
had submitted a COMPLAINT to the California Civil Rights Department CONCERNING the
PREMISES.
RESPONSE TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 13
Responding Party objects to this request on the grounds that it is vague and ambiguous
regarding the term “aware,” “served,” “submitted.” This interrogatory is overbroad, vague, unduly
burdensome, and oppressive in scope and time. Subject to the foregoing objections, and without
waiving them, Responding Party responds as follows:
After a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry, Responding Party is unable to comply with
this request as propounded, because Responding Party lacks knowledge of actions taken by
Propounding Party at the time the NOTICE was served. Discovery is ongoing and it is anticipated
that additional discovery and further investigation, legal research and analysis will supply
additional facts and provide new and different meaning to known facts, and may establish new
factual conclusions and legal contentions, all of which may result in additional changes and/or
variations from the responses set herein and Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this
response at a later time as appropriate, up to and including at trial.

waiving them, Responding Party responds as follows:

SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 16
State all the reasons you gave DEFENDANT's for wanting them to vacate premises prior
to serving them with the NOTICE.
RESPONSE TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 16
Responding Party objects in that this request seeks information equally available to
Propounding Party and is already within the Propounding Party’s possession thereby making the
request overly burdensome, oppressive, and harassing. This interrogatory is overbroad, vague,
unduly burdensome, and oppressive in scope and time. This interrogatory calls for a legal
conclusion. Responding Party also objects to this request to the extent that it seeks information
protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine
and/or premature disclosure of expert witness information in violation of Code of Civil Procedure
§§ 2018 and 2034. In addition, Responding Party also objects to this request on the grounds that
it seeks information that impairs a person’s inalienable right of privacy under the California
Constitution and disclosure would violate Responding Party and the third parties’ right to privacy.
Subject to the foregoing objections, and without waiving them, Responding Party responds as
follows:
After a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry, Responding Party is unable to comply with
this request as propounded. As phrased, request is incomprehensible leaving Responding Party
unable to determine what is being requested. Discovery is ongoing and it is anticipated that
additional discovery and further investigation, legal research and analysis will supply additional
facts and provide new and different meaning to known facts, and may establish new factual
conclusions and legal contentions, all of which may result in additional changes and/or variations
