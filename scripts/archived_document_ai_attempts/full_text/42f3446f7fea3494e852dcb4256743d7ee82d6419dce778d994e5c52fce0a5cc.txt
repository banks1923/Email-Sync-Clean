counsel which outlined the intended demurer on the grounds that the Complaint failed to allege any
facts sufficient to sustain the causes of action against Defendant. Additionally, this correspondence
outlined the intended motion to strike on the grounds that the Complaint fails to allege any ultimate
or specific facts to sustain the claim for punitive damages. A true and correct copy of this letter is
attached as “Exhibit A.”

A special demurrer attacks a pleading for uncertainty, while a general demurrer points
out substantive pleading defects such as failure to state a cause of action or affirmative
defenses (e.g., statute of limitations or waiver). (Ojavan Investors, Inc. v. California Coastal
Com. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 373, 384 fn. 8.)
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings. (Comm. on Children's Television,
Inc. v. Gen. Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 213.) A demurrer is proper when "the pleading
does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action." (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10(e).) A demurrer is also proper when the pleading is uncertain, which the code describes
as ambiguous and unintelligible. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(f).)
A pleading, on its face, must contain sufficiently plead facts to support a cause of action,
and the legal and factual conclusions of a pleader must be disregarded. (See Gruenberg v.
Aetna Ins. Co. , (1973) 9 Cal.3d 566, 572; Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co ., (1985)
166 Cal.App.3d 452 [demurrer sustained when complaint failed to allege essential facts for
any of the causes of action); Ankeny v. Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d
531, 537 [a “pleading must allege facts and not conclusions,” and “the essential facts upon
which a determination of the controversy depends should be stated with clearness and
precision so that nothing is left to surmise”].) Furthermore, a material defect in a pleading
cannot be overlooked. (See Wilhelm v. Pray, Price, Williams & Russell (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d
1324, 1331-32.)
A demurrer for uncertainty will only be sustained where the complaint is so poorly
pled that a defendant cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied,
or what counts or claims are directed against him or her Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.
B.
.
Deficiencies in the Complaint as Grounds for Demurrer
It appears that all causes of action are alleged against Defendant. The complaint does
not specify. As the property manager for a period of approximately two months, these
causes of action are not properly alleged against Defendant.
Even assuming that everything in the complaint is true (which all Defendants dispute),
there is insufficient facts to maintain the tortuous breach of warranty of habitability; breach
of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; nuisance; business & professions Code section 17200 et
seq; negligence; breach of contract; and declaratory relief causes of action against
Defendant.
Put another way, Plaintiffs’ complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute any
cause of action against Defendant. (CCP § 430.10(e).) Allegations surrounding the actions of
the Defendant do not begin until paragraph 30 of the complaint, where it states that
Plaintiffs were informed that the Defendant would be managing the property effective
September 5, 2024. (See Complaint, ¶30.) The management of the property ceased on
November 30, 2024.
There are no facts indicating that Defendant’s actions were negligent, or caused any
breach of the warranty of habitability or quiet enjoyment. Furthermore, as the property
manager, it is entirely unclear how the “business & professions code section 17200 et seq”
and “declaratory relief” causes of action can apply to Defendant. Indeed, the declaratory

relief cause of action refers to an addendum in the lease agreement that does not even
exist.
C. Grounds for Motion to Strike
Cross-Defendants’ claims for punitive damages fail as a matter of law. California Civil
Code section 3294(a) allows for the recovery of punitive damages only where plaintiffs
establish by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant acted with malice, oppression,
or fraud in connection with tortious conduct at issue. At the pleading state, plaintiffs must
demonstrate specific facts demonstrating clear circumstances of malice, oppression, or fraud
in order to be entitled to this relief. ( Grieves v. Sup. Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166-
167; see also Cyrus v. Haveson (1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 306, 316-317 (to support a punitive
damage claim, a complaint must allege ultimate facts of a defendant’s conduct.) When a
complaint fails to include sufficient specific factual allegations to support a claim for punitive
damages, a motion to strike such claims should be granted. ( Id . at 159; see also Henderson
v. Security National Bank ( 1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 764, 771 (stating that punitive damages
should only be allowed in the “clearest of cases.”) A “conclusory characterization of
defendant’s conduct as intentional, willful and fraudulent is a patently insufficient statement
of ‘oppression, fraud, malice, express or implied,’ within the meaning of section 3294.”
( Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.)
Here, the complaint fails to assert any specific facts showing such punitive behavior
on behalf of Defendant. It lacks any specific factual assertions showing that Defendant acted
with oppression, fraud, or malice. Indeed, there are only a few sentences in the entire
complaint that even mention Defendant at all.
The Complaint does not include ultimate facts needed to support instances of malice,
oppression, or fraud. Instead, the Complaint contains generic allegations that purportedly
apply to Defendant (and all Defendants) without further specificity as to who did what and
when. As established in the Grieves decision, “at the pleading state, plaintiffs must
demonstrate specific facts demonstrating clear circumstances of malice, oppression, or
fraud, in order to be entitled to this relief.” Grieves, supra 157 Cal.App.3d at 166-167.
,
Therefore, the Complaint falls short of the necessarily high standard for punitive
damages. Defendant will seek removal of the request for punitive damages via a motion to
strike.
D.
Conclusion
Please advise if you are willing to amend the Complaint in light of the above
considerations. If we do not hear from your office, then we will proceed with filing the
demurrer and motion to strike on behalf of Defendant. Should you wish to discuss this
further, please do not hesitate to contact our office with any questions.
Very truly yours,
