Basic Mold Inspection Details:
A basic mold inspection by an MI&T inspector includes a full visual assessment of a property's readily accessible areas
with use of specific tools of our trade in order to identify any possible "red flags" that could be causing a mold growth
problem. It also includes the collection of 2 air samples. The first must be taken from outside and serves as a "control,"
every home or business has "normal" levels of mold and this will determine what is acceptable for a property in your
area. It also shows that all the equipment/supplies used were working properly and makes our results legally binding. The
other air sample is taken from the area inside the home or business that the inspector and client agree is the area of
greatest concern. These 2 air samples will determine whether or not elevated conditions exist at the property in question.
Advanced Mold Testing:
For those that wish to confirm the source of a mold problem and receive specific instructions for remediation, additional
mold testing is necessary. We offer surface samples via tape lift/swabs and in-wall cavity air samples to accomplish this
task. When an inspector finds something specific that they believe is compromising the indoor air quality of a property,
he will suggest one of the above samples mentioned. If the problem shown by the general air sample is the same seen at
the localized testing location, we can not only confirm that is the source of a problem, but also offer exactly what you
need to do in order to fix it. If the problem area is large enough, multiple samples may be suggested to establish precisely
what has been contaminated. Additional general air samples are also beneficial to determine how far an air quality
problem has spread.

To whom it may concern,
Based on the findings of the visual inspection and lab results of samples collected during the inspection, it
is our professional opinion that the area be treated as contaminated due to recurring exterior moisture
intrusion and current excess moisture content of building materials.
Elevated Airborne Mold Conditions Exist: NO
Excess Moisture Content Present: YES
Recurring Moisture Intrusion: YES
Professional Mold Remediation Recommended: YES
CHOOSING A MOLD REMEDIATION COMPANY:
It is important to understand there is a difference between a general remodel and a mold remediation.
Later in this document we will lay out recommended remediation steps. This protocol should be carried
out by a restoration company/technician with both education and experience dealing with mold. While
some general contractors are prepared to complete a mold remediation properly, the majority are not
equipped to carry out all the recommend steps unless restoration is a focus of the business. Failure to
complete all of the steps may result in lingering indoor air quality problems or even worse, the mold
problem returning entirely.
Many of our clients turn to us for a recommendation on what company to use for the mold removal. In an
effort to stay separate from the restoration process and help our clients with this process, we have
compiled a list of reputable companies in your area. MI&T is not affiliated with these companies. If you
have a negative experience with one of them please inform us and we will re-evaluate their placement.
Requirements to be listed: IICRC Certified, Properly Licensed, Insured,
No Unclosed BBB Complaints, Positive Online Reputation.

Additional Notes: Client stated multiple previous water intrusion incidents. Multiple rooms have an
audible "squish" when stepping upon flooring, with some areas squeezing out water. Suspect growth
beneath Closet flooring, with moisture staining present on flooring as well as the concrete slab. No active
plumbing leaks were found at the time of inspection. Signs point to recurring exterior water intrusion
(Category 2 water from the time of initial moistue intrusion) due to inadequate exterior drainage. While
the air sample collected shows normal airborne fungal ecology at the time of inspection, the conditions
necessary for mold growth to proliferate are all present. Air samples are not an indication of either past
nor future exposure, they are a measurement relating to the time of inspection only. Given the recurring
nature of the exterior moisture intrusion, and the affected Closet being far from the intrusion point, it
stands to reason that the rooms between the Front Door/Patio and the Closet (and possibly extending
beyond the Closet) would also be impacted. As exterior walls (which contain insulation) would be
impacted, IICRC standard for water mitigation states that, at minimum, a flood cut should be performed
on walls/framing impacted by water damage. Insulation not only will wick/absorb moisture and retain
water, but also will lose their R-value for insulative properties once moisture damage occurs. It was stated

by the client that no attempts at professional dry-out occurred. With these things in mind, it is
recommended to treat the areas affected by previous and current moisture intrusion as contaminated, and
to be treated as a remediation project under containment and negative pressure. Remediation
recommendations further into this report.
