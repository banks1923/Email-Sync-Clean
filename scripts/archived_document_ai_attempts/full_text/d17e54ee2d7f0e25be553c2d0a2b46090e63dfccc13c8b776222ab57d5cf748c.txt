WILDFIRE DISASTER ADVISORY
(For use with properties in or around areas affected by a wildfire)
(C.A.R. Form WFDA, Revised 6/22)
G
COLDWELL BANKER
REALTY
WILDFIRE DISASTERS: Buyer/Lessee is aware that as a result of recent wildfire disasters there are current and unresolved health
and safety concerns related to the aftermath and clean-up of the wildfire disaster areas, as well as unknown and possible future
concerns related to the rebuilding of infrastructure in the affected areas of the wildfires. Unfortunately, the impact of wildfires has
not been limited to the fire areas themselves. Many areas have had air quality impacted by smoke and air particulates from distant
fires. Additionally, fires continue to occur in previously unaffected areas. Fires may be an issue throughout the state of California.
WILDFIRE DISASTER CONCERNS AND ISSUES: The following non-exhaustive list represents concerns and issues that may
impact Buyer/Lessee decisions about purchasing or leasing property impacted by a wildfire disaster, both currently and in the
future. It is not intended to be, nor can it be, a check list for all issues that might arise when purchasing or leasing property
impacted by a wildfire disaster; concerns and issues include, but are not limited to:
A. Insurance related issues such as past claims, the importance of identifying the insurability of the property, and the availability
and the cost of insurance as early in the process as possible;
B. Lot clearing costs and requirements; toxic materials analysis, debris removal requirements;
C. Whether the home has been fire hardened, and if so to what extent, to help reduce the risk of the structure catching fire;
D. Local, state and federal requirements for cleanup and building approvals;
E. Air quality, soil quality, and any other environmental or personal health concerns, even after the wildfire event has ended;
F. Timelines, costs and requirements when obtaining required permits for building and utilities installation;
G. Availability of and access to electricity, gas, sewer and other public or private utility services;
H. Water delivery/potability; septic and/or sewer design; requirements and construction costs;
I.
J.
Potential redesign of streets and infrastructure including possible eminent domain, land condemnation and/or acquisition;
Inconvenience and delays due to road construction and unavailability of various goods, systems, or services; and
K. Impact that federal, state or local disaster declarations may have on materials prices, costs and rents.
BUYER/LESSEE ADVISORIES: Buyer/Lessee is advised:
A. To check early in your transaction to determine if you are able to obtain insurance on the property.
B. To investigate to their own satisfaction any and all concerns of Buyer/Lessee about the intended use of the property.
C. That the area of the wildfire disaster will likely be under construction for a protracted period of time after a fire, and
Buyer/Lessee may be inconvenienced by delays, traffic congestion, noise, dust, intermittent utilities availability.
D. That due to the extraordinary catastrophe of a wildfire, there may be changes and variations in local, state or federal laws,
codes, or requirements throughout the ongoing process of planning and rebuilding in the wildfire disaster area.
E. That some insurers have reduced or cancelled offerings for fire insurance or increased costs that impact a Buyer/Lessees
ability to afford or qualify for loans or meet income ratios for rentals.
F.
That if you are not able to obtain fire insurance and have removed property investigation or loan contingencies you may be in
breach of the purchase or rental agreement.
RESOURCES: Below is a non-exhaustive list of potential resources provided as a starting point for Buyer/Lessee investigations
and not as an endorsement or guarantee that any federal, state, county, city or other resource will provide complete advice.
A. California Department of Insurance "Wildfire Resource" http://insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/140-catastrophes
MildfireResources.cfm; 1-800-927-4357
B. Governor's Office of Emergency Services "Cal OES"

C. California Department of Forestry and Fire ("Cal Fire") https://calfire.ca.gov/ and https://www.readyforwildfire.org/
D. California Department of Transportation https://calsta.ca.gov/
E. California Attorney General https://oag.ca.gov/consumers/pricegougingduring disasters#8C1
F. The American Institute of Architects "Wildfire Recovery Resources" https://aia.org/pages/165776-wildfire-recovery-resources
G. Buyer/Lessee is advised to check all local municipalities (County, City, and/or Town where the property is located) for
additional resources.
FIRE HARDENING AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE ADVISORY:
A. California law requires certain disclosures be made concerning a property's compliance with safeguards that may
minimize the risk of a structure on the property catching fire (fire hardening) and that an agreement be reached
concerning compliance with requirements that the area surrounding structures be maintained to minimize the risk of
the spread of wildfires (defensible space). The fire hardening and defensible space laws only apply if, among other
requirements, the property is located in either a high or very high fire hazard severity zone. If there exists a final
inspection report covering fire hardening or defensible space compliance, such a report may need to be provided to the buyer.
C.A.R. Form FHDS may be used to satisfy the legal requirements.
B. WHERE TO LOCATE INFORMATION: Seller has the obligation to determine if compliance with the fire hardening and defensible
space requirements are applicable to Seller and the property. It may be possible to determine if a property is in a high or very
high fire hazard severity zone by consulting with a natural hazard zone disclosure company or reviewing the company's report.
This information may also be available through a local agency where this information should have been filed.

Information on Dampness and
Mold for Renters in California
Main points:
Living in damp or moldy buildings increases the chances of
respiratory problems like asthma.
The critical warning signs are visible mold, water damage,
damp materials, or mold smell.
• Dampness is needed for mold to grow, so if you control the
dampness, you control the mold.
• Dampness or mold indoors may make housing substandard,
per the California Health & Safety Code.
This booklet describes the increased risks to health, including specific health issues, that may
result from exposures to dampness or mold in buildings. This booklet was produced in January
2021 by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) in accordance with the 2001 Toxic
Mold Protection Act (HSC §26148).

Health Problems from Damp or
Moldy Buildings
Living or working in damp or moldy buildings
increases the risk of many harmful health problems,
including:
•
asthma attacks in people who already have
asthma
a new asthma diagnosis
. respiratory infections, such as bronchitis
•
breathing symptoms, such as hay fever, sneezing,
stuffy nose, sore throat, wheezing, breathing
difficulty, or cough
eczema or skin rash
Mold can affect people differently. How much a
person is affected depends on how sensitive they are
and on how much they are exposed. Damp or moldy
buildings are linked to health problems in people
even if they do not have allergies.
Signs of Dampness or Mold
Signs of dampness or mold that may cause health
problems include:
• visible mold (regardless of color), such as on walls
or ceilings, behind furniture or appliances, under
carpets, or even hidden in areas not seen in the
occupied areas of homes
• mold odor, noticed as an earthy, musty, or moldy
smell
• visible water damage, such as water-stains or
discoloration on walls or ceilings, peeling or
bubbled paint, warped floors, or rotting wood
• damp or moist materials, including condensation
on windows or walls
Any one of these signs indicates increased risks to
health, and the more that any of them are present,
the greater the risk of health problems. Tests that
identify the types of mold or the amounts of mold
in buildings are not useful in telling us about the
health risks. This is why CDPH does not recommend
testing for mold, such as measuring mold spores in
the air.

Causes of Building Dampness that Can
Allow Mold to Grow
The dampness that is necessary for indoor mold to
grow can come from either inside or outside a
building.
Indoor sources include:
leaking or burst water pipes, for instance under
sinks inside walls
not enough venting to the outside by open
windows or exhaust fans in places where water is
used or moisture is produced (for example,
bathrooms, laundry areas, kitchens, and water
heaters)
condensation (water droplets) on cold surfaces,
including windows
Outdoor sources include:
•
water coming in through leaky roofs or
poorly-sealed windows, or from flooding
damp, exposed dirt in crawl spaces
• outdoor surfaces that slope and drain water
toward a building, including from a downspout
Fixing Dampness and Mold Problems
The California Health & Safety Code (HSC §17920.3) says that when dampness or visible mold (or
certain other conditions) in a home is a hazard to the health of occupants, the home is
substandard and the property owner must fix the conditions. The Code excludes mold that is
"minor and found on surfaces that accumulate moisture as part of their properly functioning and
intended use."
CDPH recommends fixing dampness and mold problems as follows:
•
identifying and correcting the source of any water that may allow mold to grow
rapid drying or removal of damp materials
cleaning or removing mold and moldy materials as rapidly and safely as possible
Note: if a moldy area is simply bleached, cleaned, or painted over-without fixing the source of
the dampness-the mold is likely to grow again.

Renters in California
The California Health & Safety Code requires property owners to provide a rental unit that is safe and healthy
for the people living in it. Prospective renters should look for obvious conditions that show dampness or
mold, and also less obvious signs like water leaks under the kitchen and bathroom sinks or moldy odor in a
sealed-up home. Also look for conditions likely to cause future problems, like a bathroom that has no
working vent fan or no window that opens, or a clothes dryer without an outside vent.
For renters who suspect there is dampness or mold:
1. Tell the property owner or manager. Early detection and correction of the dampness and mold
problems can reduce the risks to your health and prevent the problem from getting worse.
2.
If your property owner will not respond to your concerns in a reasonable amount of time, contact your
local (city or county) code enforcement agency and ask for a code enforcement officer to inspect for
violations. Many dampness or mold problems in rental homes are the responsibility of the property
owner and must be addressed by them. However, a code enforcement officer may determine that
dampness or mold in a building results from a tenant's actions or inactions - for instance, not using
available bathroom ventilation during showers.
3. If the local inspector determines there is a violation, they can require the property owner to correct the
problem.

Home, visit www.cdph.ca.gov/mold.
Property owners must provide a rental unit that is safe and healthy for the
people living in it.
Tenants must notify property owners of any dampness or mold problems.
