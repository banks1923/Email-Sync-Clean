objections, and without waiving them, Responding Party responds as follows:
After a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry, Responding Party is unable to comply with
this request as propounded. Discovery is ongoing and it is anticipated that additional discovery and
further investigation, legal research and analysis will supply additional facts and provide new and
different meaning to known facts, and may establish new factual conclusions and legal contentions,
all of which may result in additional changes and/or variations from the responses set herein and
Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response at a later time as appropriate, up
to and including at trial.

variations from the responses set herein and Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this
response at a later time as appropriate, up to and including at trial.
