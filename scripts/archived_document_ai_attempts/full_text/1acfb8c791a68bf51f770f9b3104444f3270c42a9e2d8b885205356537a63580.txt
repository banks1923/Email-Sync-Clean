time as appropriate, up to and including at trial.

Section 2030.210(a)(2), including but not limited to email exchanges attached hereto or produced
concurrently herewith. Discovery is ongoing and it is anticipated that additional discovery and
further investigation, legal research and analysis will supply additional facts and provide new and
different meaning to known facts, and may establish new factual conclusions and legal contentions,
all of which may result in additional changes and/or variations from the responses set herein and
Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response at a later time as appropriate, up
