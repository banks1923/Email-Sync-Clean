No. Discovery is ongoing and it is anticipated that additional discovery and further
investigation, legal research and analysis will supply additional facts and provide new and different
meaning to known facts, and may establish new factual conclusions and legal contentions, all of
which may result in additional changes and/or variations from the responses set herein and
Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response at a later time as appropriate, up
to and including at trial.
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 27
State whether YOU believe that DEFENDANT'S habitability-related COMPLAINTS
were a motivating factor in YOUR decision to serve the NOTICE.
RESPONSE TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 27
Responding Party objects to this request on the grounds that it is vague and ambiguous
regarding the term “state,” “habitability-related.” Responding Party objects to this request on the
grounds that it is vague and ambiguous regarding the term “habitability” as it calls for a legal
conclusion. This interrogatory is compound, overbroad, vague, unduly burdensome, and
oppressive in scope and time. Responding Party also objects to this request to the extent that it
seeks information protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and attorney work
product doctrine and/or premature disclosure of expert witness information in violation of Code of
Civil Procedure §§ 2018 and 2034. In addition, Responding Party also objects to this request on
the grounds that it seeks information that impairs a person’s inalienable right of privacy under the
California Constitution and disclosure would violate Responding Party and the third parties’ right
to privacy. Subject to the foregoing objections, and without waiving them, Responding Party
responds as follows:
No. Discovery is ongoing and it is anticipated that additional discovery and further
investigation, legal research and analysis will supply additional facts and provide new and different
meaning to known facts, and may establish new factual conclusions and legal contentions, all of

SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 28
IDENTIFY all PERSONS involved in the preparation, drafting, or service of the
NOTICE.
RESPONSE TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 28
Responding Party objects to this request on the grounds that it is vague and ambiguous
regarding the term “preparation,” “drafting.” Responding Party objects in that this request seeks
information equally available to Propounding Party and is already within the Propounding Party’s
possession thereby making the request overly burdensome, oppressive, and harassing. This
interrogatory is compound, duplicative of other discovery requests, overbroad, vague, unduly
burdensome, and oppressive in scope and time. Responding Party also objects to this request to the
extent that it seeks information protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and
attorney work product doctrine and/or premature disclosure of expert witness information in
violation of Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2018 and 2034. In addition, Responding Party also objects
to this request on the grounds that it seeks information that impairs a person’s inalienable right of
privacy under the California Constitution and disclosure would violate Responding Party and the
third parties’ right to privacy. Subject to the foregoing objections, and without waiving them,
Responding Party responds as follows:
Responding Party exercises its right to produce writings under Code of Civil Procedure
Section 2030.210(a)(2). Discovery is ongoing and it is anticipated that additional discovery and
further investigation, legal research and analysis will supply additional facts and provide new and
different meaning to known facts, and may establish new factual conclusions and legal contentions,
all of which may result in additional changes and/or variations from the responses set herein and
Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response at a later time as appropriate, up

regarding the term “state,” “any statements,” “frustration,” “concern,” “annoyance.” Responding

responds as follows:

and further investigation, legal research and analysis will supply additional facts and provide new
and different meaning to known facts, and may establish new factual conclusions and legal
contentions, all of which may result in additional changes and/or variations from the responses set
herein and Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response at a later time as
appropriate, up to and including at trial.
