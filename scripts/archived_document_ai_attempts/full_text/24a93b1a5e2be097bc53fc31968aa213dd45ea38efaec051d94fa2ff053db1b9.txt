PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
These responses are made only for the purpose of the within action. Each response or
answer is subject to all objections as to competence, relevance, materiality, propriety, admissibility
and any other objections and grounds that would require the exclusion of any statement herein if
any document was asked of, or if any statement contained therein were made by a witness present
and testifying in court, all of which objections and grounds are reserved and may be interposed at
the time of trial.
Plaintiff is responding to all Requests to the extent that information has become known
by him. However, this responding party’s discovery, investigation and preparation for trial of this
matter has not been completed as of the date of these responses, and, therefore, Plaintiff does not
purport to state anything more than information presently known and discovered by him.
Plaintiff, in responding to these Requests, reserves the right to continue discovery and
investigation in this matter for facts, witnesses and supporting data that may recall information
which, if he had presently within his knowledge, would be included in these responses. For
example, to the extent that any request calls for the identification of ‘all documents,” it is responded
to fully insofar as information is presently available to Plaintiff, and Plaintiff is not precluded from
presenting at trial information discovered after the date of the response of this request.
This preliminary statement is incorporated into each of the responses set forth below.
GENERAL OBJECTIONS
To avoid repetition in setting forth specific objections to interrogatories, responding party
sets forth and incorporates the following objections to responding party’s each and every response.
A. RELEVENCY OBJECTION
Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory, in whole or in part, seek the

disclosure of information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of the action nor reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
B. CONFIDENTIALITY/PRIVACY OBJECTION
Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory seeks the disclosure of confidential
information and constitute an attempt to invade the personal and/or financial privacy of certain
individuals or persons.
C. OVERBREADTH AND BURDEN OBJECTION
Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is overbroad, burdensome and
oppressive in that they seek the disclosure of information that has little or no practical benefit to
propounding party while placing an unwarranted burden or expense on the responding party in
ascertaining such information. Further, such interrogatory is so broadly drawn that although it
may include some relevant information within its scope, it includes information that is irrelevant
or immaterial to the instant action. Such interrogatory seeks information which is cumulative
and/or would require the compilation of extensive and detailed information from numerous
potential sources, many of which is not easily identifiable or available. A search for all such
information will in many instances involve enormous amounts of time by responding party.
Further, the interrogatory is so overbroad such that it is uncertain what information is sought.
D. AMBIGUITY OBJECTION
Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is phrased in language that is
vague, ambiguous, and uncertain such that responding party is unable to ascertain what
information is sought and in order to respond to this interrogatory, responding party would have
to speculate as to propounding party’s intended meaning.
E. AVAILABILITY OBJECTION

Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is equally accessible to all parties
or is more accessible to the propounding party or which is maintained primarily by persons or
entities other than responding party.
F. IMPROPER FORM OBJECTION
Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is phrased in improper form
because the interrogatory is not “full and complete in and of itself”; or because it contains subpart,
“compound, conjunctive or disjunctive” question, such that the interrogatory does not comply with
the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure §2030.060
G. LEGAL CONCLUSION OBJECTION
Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory calls for a legal conclusion.
H. ATTORNEY WORK-PRODUCT OBJECTION
Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory, in whole or in part,
seeks disclosure of information that is protected under the attorney work-product doctrine.
I. MARITAL PRIVILEGE OBJECTION
Responding party objects on the basis that the request, in whole or in part, seek
disclosure of information that is protected under marital privilege.
