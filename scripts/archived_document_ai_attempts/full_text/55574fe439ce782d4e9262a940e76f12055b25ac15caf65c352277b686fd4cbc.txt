MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
I. INTRODUCTION
This case is a habitability matter. Plaintiffs JAMES BURBANK and JENNIFER
BURBANK (hereinafter referred to as “Plaintiffs”) allege that their rented condominium unit was
5 uninhabitable and caused them injuries. Plaintiffs filed their complaint for damages on November
6
7
25, 2024. The Complaint consists of seven causes of action for: (1) tortious breach of warranty of
habitability; (2) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; (3) nuisance; (4) Business &
8 Professions Code § 17200 et seq.; (5) negligence; (6) breach of contract; and (7) declaratory relief.
9
10
11
The named Defendants are the owners and a short-term property management company.
Here, the Complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendant,
either directly or by reasonable inference. Defendant LOTUS PROPERTY SERVICES, INC. only
12 served as the property manager for less than three months.

15

17
18
19
Defendant demurs to all seven causes of action of Plaintiffs’ Complaint on the grounds that
no cause of action states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the Defendant.
II. MEET AND CONFER EFFORTS PRIOR TO FILING MOTION
On July 23, 2025, Defendant’s counsel filed a Notice of Inability to Meet and Confer with
counsel, which provided a thirty-day extension of time to respond to Plaintiffs’ complaint.
(Declaration of Shanna M. Van Wagner, (“SMV Decl.”), ¶ 3.)
On July 25, 2025, Defendant’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiffs’ counsel
20 which outlined the intended demurer on the grounds that the Complaint failed to allege any facts
21 sufficient to sustain the causes of action against Defendant. (SMV Decl., ¶ 4.) Additionally, this
correspondence outlined the intended motion to strike on the grounds that the Complaint fails to
allege any ultimate or specific facts to sustain the claim for punitive damages. (Id.)
22
23
24
25
26
On July 31, 2025, a representative from Plaintiffs’ counsel informed us that the letter was
“under review.” (SMV Decl., ¶ 5.)
On August 19, 2025, Defendant’s counsel requested a response to whether Plaintiffs would
27 amend their Complaint. (Id.) To date, Defendant’s counsel received no response. (Id.)

III. LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER
A party against whom a complaint has been filed may object by demurrer on grounds that
the pleading “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§ 430.10(e).) A demurrer “may be taken to the whole complaint . . . or to any of the causes of action
stated therein.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.50(a).) California courts hold that “[a] general
6 demurrer is concerned with the question of whether the facts pleaded constitute a cause of action,
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
and is properly sustained only in those instances where no cause of action at all is shown by the
complaint.” (Los Angeles County v. Read (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 748, 751 (internal citations
omitted); see Ojavan Investors, Inc. v. California Coastal Com. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 373, 384 n.8
(noting general demurrer “points out substantive pleading defects such as failure to state a cause of
action or affirmative defenses”).)
A demurrer is properly based on the complaint itself, as well as upon matters of which the
Court is required to or may take judicial notice. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.30(a).) The court
assessing a general demurrer accepts as true the “material facts properly pleaded” in the complaint,
15 but rejects “contentions, deductions[,] or conclusions of fact or law.” (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
16 Cal.3d 311, 318 (internal citations omitted); George v. Automobile Club of Southern Cal. (2011)
17 201 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1120 (noting that whereas a demurrer “admits all facts properly pleaded, [it
does] not [admit] contentions, deductions[,] or conclusions of law or fact”).)
18
19
20
In ruling upon a general demurrer, “effect must be given to every allegation in the
complaint; and the demurrer must be overruled if the complaint states, or from its averments it can
21 be reasonably inferred, that plaintiff has a cause of action against defendant on any theory.” (Beason
22
v. Griff (1954) 127 Cal.App.2d 382, 386–87 (internal citations omitted). Additionally, it is a well-
23 established rule that “although a general demurrer must be sustained if the complaint fails to state a
24
25
cause of action, it shall not be sustained without leave to amend if it is subject to amendment to state
a cause of action . . . .” (Mull v. Hunter (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 657, 659 (internal quotations and
26 citations omitted).)
27 IV. PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE SUFFICIENT FACTS
28
In evaluating a demurrer, the court assumes the truth of all material facts which have been
6
DEFENDANT’S NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT;
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
1
2
properly pleaded, of facts which may be inferred from those expressly pleaded, and of any material
facts of which judicial notice has been requested and may be taken. (Crowley v. Katleman (1994) 8
3 Cal.4th 666, 672.) A demurrer does not admit contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.||
4
5
6
7
(Dear v. Yellow Cab Company (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695. Further, the complaint allegations must be
supported by “ultimate facts,” not legal conclusions. (Burke v. Superior Court (1969) 71 Cal.2d
276.)
This demurrer should be sustained to all causes of action, as Plaintiffs have failed to allege
8 sufficient ultimate facts to state claims for those causes of action.
9
10
11
A.
Plaintiffs Fail to State Facts Sufficient to Support the First Cause of Action for
Tortuous [sic] Breach of Warranty of Habitability
The elements of a cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability “are the
12 existence of a material defective condition affecting the premises' habitability, notice to the landlord
13
14
of the condition within a reasonable time after the tenant's discovery of the condition, the landlord
was given a reasonable time to correct the deficiency, and resulting damages.” (Erlach v. Sierra
15 Asset Servicing, LLC (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1297.)
16
18
Defendant managed the property for less than three months. The key term is whether the
17 defective is material. In Plaintiffs’ Complaint, they note that an inspector from the Los Angeles
Department of Public Health came to the unit to conduct an inspection. According to the Complaint,
19 the inspector “found peeling paint on the windowsill in the living room.” (Complaint, ¶ 51.) Peeling
paint does not rise to the level of a material condition that impacts the habitability of the premises.
20
21
22
The Complaint then alleges that the Defendant (which one?) is an experienced property
owner and manager of residential property throughout Los Angeles County and is aware that
23 construction done without permits and inspections…” There is no construction referred to in the rest
24
of the Complaint. Paragraphs 77 through 82 contain conclusory statements void of factual support.
25 Notably, these paragraphs refer to a single Defendant. There are seven (7) Defendants named in
26 the Complaint.
27
As such, there are insufficient facts sufficient to sustain this cause of action against
28 Defendant.

Plaintiffs Fail to State Facts Sufficient to Support the Second Cause of Action
for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
Minor inconveniences typically do not qualify as breaches. The landlord’s actions must
4 substantially interfere with the ability to enjoy the property. As noted above, the Complaint varies
5 between reference to a single, unnamed Defendant, and Defendants without specification.
6
Furthermore, as noted in the Complaint, Plaintiffs then explicitly state that the Leasing Defendant
7 breached the implied warranty of habitability (Complaint, ¶ 51.) As Defendant was not the Leasing||

Defendant, this cause of action fails to state sufficient facts as to the moving Defendant.
C.
Plaintiffs Fail to State Facts Sufficient to Support the Third Cause of Action for
Nuisance and the Fifth Cause of Action for Negligence
Where negligence and nuisance causes of action rely on the same facts about lack of due
care, the nuisance claim is a negligence claim. (City of San Diego v. U.S. Gypsum Co., supra, 30
Cal.App.4th at p. 587; Martinez v. Pacific Bell (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1557, 1565; [“where the
alleged nuisance is the result of the defendant's alleged negligent conduct, rules of negligence are
applied”].))
A cause of action alleging a continuing nuisance is usually accompanied by a request for an
injunction. (El Escorial Owners' Assn. v. DLC Plastering, Inc., (2007) 154 Cal. App. 4th 1337,
1349, as modified on denial of reh'g (Oct. 3, 2007). )
In Escorial, Plaintiff’s cause of action for nuisance incorporated the same facts as the cause
of action for negligence. The trial court reasonably found that Escorial's nuisance cause of action
was merely a clone of the first cause of action using a different label. Van Zyl v. Spiegelberg (1969)
2 Cal.App.3d 367, 372–373; see also Atherton Condominium Apartment–Owners Assn. Bd. of
23 Directors v. Blume Development Co., , 115 Wash.2d 506, 527, 799 P.2d 250, 263 [in construction
24 defect case “a ‘negligence claim presented in the garb of nuisance’ need not be considered apart
25 from the negligence claim”].) “ ‘... “The torts of negligence and nuisance ... frequently are,
26 coexisting and practically inseparable.... A nuisance in many, if not in most, instances, especially
27 with respect to buildings or premises, presupposes negligence.”...’ [Citations.]” Lussier v. San
28 Lorenzo Valley Water Dist., supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p. 104.)

Paralleling what the Court faced in Escorial, Plaintiffs’ Nuisance claim does not include a
request for an injunction. The claim incorporates all the same alleged facts for Negligence. It is
duplicative, seeks no unique damages, and provides no unique remedies. Furthermore, both causes
of action contain sweeping conclusions as to the conduct of unspecified Defendants. As such, the
demurrer as to these causes of action must be sustained.
D.
Plaintiffs Fail to State Facts Sufficient to Support the Fourth Cause of Action
for Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq.
1.
Plaintiffs Fail to Plead Injury in Fact
Business and Professions Code sections 17200 et seq. (commonly referred to as Unfair
Competition Law, which is “UCL” hereinafter) provides for “limited remedies” in a private action.
Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1152. Indeed, an action
12 under the UCL is equitable in nature; damages and penalties cannot be recovered in a private
13 action. (Id. at 1444; 1150.) Rather, private plaintiff's potential remedies under UCL are limited to
14
15
16
17
18
19
injunctive relief and restitution. Here, Plaintiffs seek restitution, however, the property manager
would not owe restitution to the Plaintiffs.
Section 17204 provides that a private person has standing to sue only if he “has suffered
injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.” (Daro v. Sup.
Ct. (James Foy) (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1097.) California Appellate courts require that a
private plaintiff under UCL show a distinct and palpable injury that is concrete. (Peterson v.
20 Cellco Partnership (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1591.) In reaching such a conclusion and in an
21
effort to curb abuses of the UCL, the Cellco Partnership court reasoned that there must be an
22 “actual economic injury.” (Id.)
In this case, plaintiffs fail to properly allege an actual economic injury. Rather, in vague
23
24 and general terms, plaintiffs allege that they sustained economic injury. Thus, plaintiffs
25
26
27
28
additionally fail to properly plead an injury in fact.
2.
Plaintiffs fail to properly allege conduct by Defendant that amounted to a
violation of the UCL.
The primary purpose of § 17200 is to protect consumers against “unlawful,” unfair” or
9
DEFENDANT’S NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT;
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
1 “fraudulent” business practices. (Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn. (1972) 7 Cal.3d 94,|| 
2
111.) Unfair business practices are those which are immoral, unethical, oppressive or
3
unscrupulous. (State Farm v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 193, 1104.) As was stated in
4 CelTech Communications Inc. v. LA Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 187, unfair
5 business practices is “conduct which threatens an incipient violation of an anti-trust law, or
6 violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws, because its effects are comparable to or the same
7
as a violation of the law or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.”
8 “Practice” generally means the habitual doing of certain things, the doing of an act more than once
9
... or repeated or customary action.” (Wilson v. Stearns (1954) 123 Cal.App.2d 472, 479.) It is a
10 “pattern of behavior pursued in the course of business.” (People v. Casablanca Convalescent
Home, Inc. (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 509, 527.)
11
12
13
14
15
16
Moreover, the California courts routinely require a plaintiff alleging unfair business
practices under the UCL to plead facts supporting the alleged UCL violation with reasonable
particularity. (Perdue v. Crocker National Bank (1985) 38 Cal.3d 913, 929; see, e.g., 5 Witkin,
Cal. Procedure (3rd ed. 1985) Pleading, § 728, p. 176.)
In Khoury v. Malys of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, the court explained:
17 “[The] demurrer was properly sustained ... because the ... complaint identifies no particular section
18
of the statutory scheme which was violated and fails to describe with any reasonable particularity
19 the facts supporting the violation. The complaint refers to a ‘effective misleading,’ ... but the facts
20
21
22
clearly do not involve deceptive advertising (See, Business & Professions Code § 17200), [unfair
competition includes deceptive or misleading advertising], 17500 et seq. [specific false advertising
practices], nor do the facts explain the manner of misleading .... The complaint does not describe
23 the manner in which respondent's practice is ‘unlawful’ ... the facts do not involve monopolistic or
anti-competitive practice (See, Business & Professions Code § 17201), because appellant is not in
competition with the respondent.” Id. at 619 (emphasis added).
24
25
26
Plaintiffs' fifth cause of action for unfair business practices is deficient in all respects. First,
27 Plaintiffs have not shown any business “practice” on the part of Defendant which is subject to the
28 statute. The allegations set forth in the Complaint clearly do not indicate a “pattern of behavior,”|| 
10
DEFENDANT’S NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT;
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
1

3
much less from the moving Defendant.
Section 17200, is violated if a business practice is unlawful or unfair or deceptive. (Cel–
Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 180 (Cel–
4 Tech Communications ).) “[A] practice is prohibited as ‘unfair’ or ‘deceptive’ even if not ‘unlawful’
5
6
and vice versa.” (State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1093,
1102, disapproved on other grounds in Cel–Tech Communications, supra, at p. 187, fn. 12.) To
7 show a business practice is unfair, the plaintiff must show the conduct “threatens an incipient
|| 
8
9
10
violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects
are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms
competition.” (Cel–Tech Communications, supra, at p. 186.)

Plaintiffs Fail to State Facts Sufficient to Support the Sixth Cause of Action
for Breach of Contract
Plaintiffs do not allege any contract with Defendant. Further, this cause of action appears
duplicative of the others. Thus, the demurrer on this cause of action should be sustained.
F.
Plaintiffs Fail to State Facts Sufficient to Support the Seventh Cause of Action
for Declaratory Relief
Not only do Plaintiffs fail to state sufficient facts to support this cause of action, but it does
not make sense. Paragraph 116 refers to an addendum which was not attached to the Complaint. It
19 is entirety unclear for what the Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief.
