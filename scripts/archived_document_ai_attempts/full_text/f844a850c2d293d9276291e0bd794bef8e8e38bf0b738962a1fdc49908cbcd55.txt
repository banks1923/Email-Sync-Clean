If your advanced mold testing report came back showing elevated levels of mold, it should have a supplementary test(s)
confirming the source of a problem. This report should have detailed findings for each additional sample taken. When
a test indicates a problem, we identify which remediation steps must be performed at that area. Below you will find a
more detailed explanation of each of those steps. If professional mold remediation is recommended, this work should
be carried out by a mold removal professional that is trained and has the equipment necessary to complete each task
as instructed. Please do not attempt to handle this work on your own. Doing so puts your health and the health of other
occupants of the property at risk.

Description of Work Area If Necessary: Based on mold test results and inspection, it is recommended to
treat the area as contaminated due to recurring moisture intrusion (Category 2 water as originating from
an exterior source) and the likelihood of excess moisture content and mold growth within the wall
cavities. A professional restoration company should be contracted to perform the necessary remediation.
The following work should be carried out:
An active moisture intrusion/leak exists in the area. Consult with the appropriate licensed contractor to
repair the source of the moisture prior to remediation, or in conjunction with the remediation, as
applicable.
As work will be taking place throughout, containment is not necessary. Due to the entry area being part of

the remediation, access to the home will be impeded by the work taking place. As such, it is
recommended to vacate the premises during any work being performed.
Set up air scrubbers of appropriate CFM for the volume of the work area, to be exhausted outside of the
building, using negative pressure. As actively wet structural materials exist, a dehumidifier should be used
during remediation. Air movers are NOT to be installed and used until all affected non-structural building
materials have been removed, and the area has been appropriately cleaned. All structural building material
needs to be returned to a normal moisture content.
All porous and non-porous personal contents without moisture damage or visible growth within the work
area should be removed from the work area. All fibrous contents and non-porous personal contents with
moisture damage or visible growth should be evaluated by a restoration/remediation contractor to either
be cleaned and removed from the work area, or discarded.
Remove all affected non-structural material (baseboard, door trim, drywall, insulation, tack strip, carpet,
pad, vinyl flooring, laminate flooring, etc. as applicable) to a minimum of 12" beyond any visible growth
or moisture damage found, including within the wall cavity and beneath non-structural flooring. Continue
non-structural material removal until all instances of visible growth and moisture damage have been
removed, and all instances of visible growth and moisture damage on structural material have been
exposed. All insulation exposed during affected material removal should be removed and discarded, not
to be replaced until after clearance testing. All structural material exposed by removing affected non-
structural material should remain open and accessible until after clearance testing. **Note: Non-porous
flooring that was impacted can be cleaned, set aside, and reused once rebuild occurs. Tile on slab does
NOT have to be removed unless an underlayment is present. All porous materials that were impacted
should be discarded.**
**If damage extends to Kitchen**
Any affected cabinetry should be removed and discarded. Remove all affected non-structural material
(baseboard, door trim, drywall, insulation, tack strip, carpet, pad, vinyl flooring, laminate flooring, etc. as
applicable) to a minimum of 12" beyond any visible growth or moisture damage found, including within
the wall cavity and beneath non-structural flooring. Continue non-structural material removal until all
instances of visible growth and moisture damage have been removed, and all instances of visible growth
and moisture damage on structural material have been exposed. All insulation exposed during affected
material removal should be removed and discarded, not to be replaced until after clearance testing. All
structural material exposed by removing affected non structural material should remain open and
accessible until after clearance testing.
**If damaged extends to Bathroom**
-Affected vanity should be removed and discarded, if applicable.
-Remove toilet for access to affected flooring and drywall, if applicable.
-Tile and drywall/backerboard surrounding tub/shower should be removed and discarded, if applicable.
-Tub/shower pan should be removed, if applicable.

structural material should remain open and accessible until after clearance testing.
Clean and treat all surfaces within the work area. All vertical and horizontal surfaces are to be cleaned by
HEPA vacuuming, and wiping with an anti-microbial. Run air scrubbers on negative pressure throughout
material removal and cleaning. Switch air scrubbers to scrub-only for 48 hours after completion of final
cleaning. Shut off air scrubbers 24 hours prior to clearance testing. All exposed structural material is to
remain accessible for verification of dry and clean conditions. MI&T recommends clearance testing
before rebuild process begins to ensure work has been completed properly.
Due to the fact that our observations are made during limited time on site, we are unable to determine the
exact cause of the humidity issue, but seems likely that it is related to the recurring exterior moisture
intrusion and retention of water in building materials. Some additional suggestions that should be
followed to ensure the mold problems do not return:
-Keep humidity at or below 50% throughout.
-An Air Conditioner's purpose is to not only cool a building but also to serve as a dehumidifier. It should
be used even when unoccupied.
-Avoid having large items placed directly on exterior walls as these walls need to breathe in order to cool
off and avoid condensation and mold growth.
-If you close vents in unused rooms, be sure to monitor humidity levels.
-Utilize Exhaust fans and leave doors open to rooms prone to humidity like closets, bathrooms, and
laundry rooms.
-Consider installing a dehumidifier in any troubling area; basements, additions, poorly insulated, etc.
Since air samples indicate problem is not yet airborne, an air duct cleaning is not necessary but it may
want to consider it as an extra precaution and recommended to improve air quality even if a mold problem
does not exist.
It is imperative that any source of water intrusion be addressed to ensure mold growth does not return.

#1: Vacating the Premises
Vacating people from the adjacent spaces is usually only necessary for a large/widespread problem but is also
recommended for individuals with reduced immune systems, elderly, infants, recent surgery patients, people with
chronic inflammatory lung disease or individuals with respiratory health concerns.
#2: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Full-face respirators are to be worn.
Gloves are to be worn to remove all infected building materials.
Disposable Tyvek coveralls covering both the head and shoes shall be worn.
#3: Containment of Each of the Contaminated Area
Complete isolation of the work area using plastic (6 mil poly) sheeting sealed with tape.
If a containment area blocks the only entrance, vacating the property is usually recommended during remediation.
If the problem is widespread and the entire property needs remediation, no containment is necessary.
This area should be large enough to house any contaminated materials
Sealing with plastic sheeting (6 mil poly) all ventilation, ducts/grills, fixtures and other openings.
#4: Negative Pressure Used
Use an exhaust fan with a HEPA filter to generate negative pressurization (ventilating to the outdoors). Use the
appropriate sized unit for the space. The air exchange rate must be six times per hour.
#5: HEPA Vacuum
Any area that is in the same area of contaminated materials should be HEPA vacuumed, starting at highest point
and working down to the floor.
Any area that is contained should be completely HEPA-Vaced.
This should be done before AND after removing contaminated materials.
If the entire property is contaminated, the entire property needs to be HEPA-Vaced.
#6: Applying Biocide
Apply biocide to visible fungal growth prior to removal of material. Wait thirty minutes before removing the
material. This provides sufficient time for the biocide to disinfect the material and reduces the dust generated
because the material is wetted.
This should be done before AND after removing contaminated materials
#7: Removal and Discarding of Contaminated Materials
Remove infected drywall, insulation and building material least twelve inches past any visual mold.
All debris should be double bagged in 3 mil contractor bags twisted, goose necked and sealed with duct tape.
The sealed bags are to be wiped clean with the appropriate disinfectant in the containment before transport to the
disposal area.
