INFORMATION ABOUT BED BUGS:
1. Bed Bug Appearance: Bed bugs have six legs. Adult bed bugs have flat bodies about 1/4 of an inch in tength. Their color can varyfrom red and brown to copper colored. Young bed bugs are very small. Their bodies are about 1/16 of an inch in length. They havealmost no color. When a bed bug feeds, its body sweils, may lengthen, and becomes bright red, sometimes making it appear to bea different insect. Bed bugs do not fly. They can either crawl or be carried from place to place on objects, people, or animals. Bedbugs can be hard to find and identify because they are tiny and try to stay hidden.2. Life Cycle and Reproduction: An average bed bug lives for about 10 months. Female bed bugs lay one to five eggs per day. Bedbugs grow to full adulthood in about 21 days.3. Bed bugs can survive for months without feeding.4. Bed Bug Bites: Because bed bugs usually feed at night, most people are bitten in their sleep and do not realize they were bitten.A person's reaction to insect bites is an immune response and so varies from person to person. Sometimes the red welts causedby the bites will not be noticed until many days after a person was bitten, if at all.5. Common signs and symptoms of a possible bed bug infestation:Small red to reddish brown fecal spots on mattresses, box springs, bed frames, mattresses, linens, upholstery, or walls.Molted bed bug skins, white, sticky eggs, or empty eggshells.Very heavily infested areas may have a characteristically sweet odor.Red, itchy bite marks, especially on the legs, arms, and other body parts exposed while sleeping. However, some people donot show bed bug lesions on their bodies even though bed bugs may have fed on them.6. For more information, see the Internet Web sites of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the National PestManagement Association.7. Tenant shall report suspected infestations by bed bugs to the Housing Provider or Property Manager at the mailing, oremail address or phone number provided in the Agreement and cooperate with any inspection for and treatment of bed bugs.8. Housing Provider will notify tenants of any units inspected by a pest control operator of the findings by such an operator within 2business days of the receipt of the findings. All Tenants will be notified of confirmed infestations within common areas.
