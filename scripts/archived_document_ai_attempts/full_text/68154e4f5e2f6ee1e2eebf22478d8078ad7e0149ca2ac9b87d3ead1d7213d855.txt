SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE TO REQUEST NO. 24
As part of this meet and confer process, Responding Party requests that Propounding
Party define the term “legal identity,” “entity.” Because this request is compound, Responding
Party requests that Propounding Party separate this request into distinct asks. Notwithstanding
and without waiving the foregoing objections, Responding Party responds as follows:
Responding Party produces all relevant documents in Responding Party’s possession or
control which are attached hereto or sent concurrently with these responses. Discovery is
ongoing and it is anticipated that additional discovery and further investigation, legal research
and analysis will supply additional facts and provide new and different meaning to known facts,
and may establish new factual conclusions and legal contentions, all of which may result in
additional changes and/or variations from the responses set herein and Responding Party reserves
the right to supplement this response at a later time as appropriate, up to and including at trial.
REQUEST NO. 25
All DOCUMENTS reflecting any COMMUNICATIONS YOU received from the
California Civil Rights Department (CRD) CONCERNING DEFENDANT or the PREMISES.
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE TO REQUEST NO. 25
As part of this meet and confer process, Responding Party requests that Propounding
Party define the term “reflecting.” Responding Party requests that Propounding Party narrow the
scope of this request to a reasonable timeframe. Because this request is compound, Responding
Party requests that Propounding Party separate this request into distinct asks. Additionally, this
request seeks confidential, private and/or privileged documents of third parties not part of this
Action, the disclosure of which would violate their right to privacy. This request seeks
information protected by disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product doctrine

and/or information prepared in anticipation of litigation, including physician-patient privilege.
Notwithstanding and without waiving the foregoing objections, Responding Party responds as
follows:
After a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry, Responding Party is unable to comply
with this request as propounded. Discovery is ongoing and it is anticipated that additional
discovery and further investigation, legal research and analysis will supply additional facts and
provide new and different meaning to known facts, and may establish new factual conclusions
and legal contentions, all of which may result in additional changes and/or variations from the
responses set herein and Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response at a
later time as appropriate, up to and including at trial.
