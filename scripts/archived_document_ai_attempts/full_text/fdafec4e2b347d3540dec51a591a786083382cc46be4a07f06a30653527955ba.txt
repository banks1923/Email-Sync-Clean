CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT ADVISORY,DISCLOSURE AND NOTICE(C.A.R. Form CCPA, Revised 12/22)
REALTY
The California Consumer Privacy Act (commencing with Civil Code § 1798.100) ("CCPA"), as amended by California votersin 2020, grants to California residents certain rights in their private, personal information ("PI") that is collected by companieswith whom they do business. Under the CCPA, PI is defined broadly to encompass non-public records information that couldreasonably be linked directly or indirectly to you. Pl could potentially include photographs of, or sales information about, yourproperty.
During the process of buying and selling real estate your Pl will be collected and likely shared with others, including realestate licensees, a Multiple Listing Service, real estate internet websites, service providers, lenders, and title and escrowcompanies, to name several possibilities. Businesses that are covered by the CCPA are required to grant you various rightsin your PI, including the right to know what Pl is collected, the right to know what Pl is sold or shared and to whom, the rightto request that the business correct or delete your PI, the right to "opt out" or stop the transfer of your PI to others, and theright to limit the use of certain Pl which is considered "sensitive." You may get one or more notices regarding your CCPArights from businesses you interact with in a real estate transaction. However, not all businesses that receive or share yourPl are obligated to comply with the CCPA. Moreover, businesses that are otherwise covered under the CCPA may have alegal obligation to maintain PI, notwithstanding your instruction to the contrary. For instance, regardless of whether they arecovered by CCPA, under California law, brokers and Multiple Listing Services are required to maintain their records for 3years. If you wish to exercise your rights under CCPA, where applicable, you should contact the respective business directly.
You can obtain more information about the CCPA and your rights under the law from the State of California Departmentof Justice (oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa). Additionally, the California Privacy Protection Agency is authorized to promulgateregulations which may further clarify requirements of the CCPA (oppa.ca.gov/regulations/).
I/we acknowledge receipt of a copy of this California Consumer Privacy Act Advisory, Disclosure and Notice.

Property Address: 518 N Stoneman Ave., Alhambra, California 91801NOTE: A seiler who is not required to provide one of the following statements of compliance is not necessarily exempt from the obligation to provide theother statement of compliance.WATER HEATER STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE1. STATE LAW: California Law requires that all new and replacement water heaters and existing residential water heaters be braced, anchored orstrapped to resist falling or horizontal displacement due to earthquake motion. "Water healer" means any standard water heater with a capacity ofno more than 120 gallons for which a pre-engineered strapping kit is readily available. (Health and Safety Code $19211d). Although not specificallystated, the statute requiring a statement of compliance does not appear to apply to a properly installed and bolted tankless water heater for thefollowing reasons: There is no tank that can overturn; Pre-engineered strapping kits for such devices are not readily available; and Bolting alreadyexists that would help avoid displacement or breakage in the event of an earthquake.2. LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: Some local ordinances impose more stringent water heater bracing. anchoring or strapping requirements than doesCalifornia Law. Therefore, it is important to check with local city or county building and safety departments regarding the applicable water heaterbracing, anchoring or strapping requirements for your property.3. TRANSFEROR'S WRITTEN STATEMENT: California Health and Safety Code $19211 requires the seller of any real property containing a waterheater to certify, in writing, that the seller is in compliance with California State Law. If the Property is a manufactured or mobile home, Seller shallalso file a required Statement with the Department of Housing and Community Development.4. CERTIFICATION: Seller represents that the Property, as of the Close Of Escrow, will be in compliance with Health and Safety Code §19211 byhaving the water heater(s) braced, anchored or strapped in place, in accordance with those requirements.なふ ABradford M.

The January 1, 2013requirement applies to a duplex, lodging house, dormitory, hotel, condominium, time-share and apartment, among others.B. Exceptions: The law does not apply to a dwelling unit which does not have any of the following: a fossil fuel burning heater orappliance, a fireplace, or an attached garage. The law does not apply to dwelling units owned or leased by the State ofCalifornia, the Regents of the University of California or local government agencies. Aside from these three owner types, thereare no other owner exemptions from the installation requirement; it applies to all owners of dwellings, be they individualbanks, corporations, or other entities. There is no exemption for REO properties.
2.
DISCLOSURE OF CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS: The Health and Safety Code does not require a disclosure regarding theexistence of carbon monoxide detectors in a dwelling. However, a seller of residential 1-4 property who is required to complete aReal Estate Transfer Disclosure Statement, (C.A.R. Form TDS) or a Manufactured Home and Mobile home Transfer DisclosureStatement (C.A.R. Form MHTDS) must use section II A of that form to disclose if the dwelling unit has a carbon monoxide detector.
3.
COMPLIANCE WITH INSTALLATION REQUIREMENT: State building code requires at a minimum, placement of carbon monoxidedetectors in applicable properties outside of each sleeping area, and on each floor in a multi-level dwelling but additional or differentrequirements may apply depending on local building standards and manufacturer instructions. An owner who fails to install a carbonmonoxide detector when required by law and continues to fail to install the detector after being given notice by a governmentalagency could be liable for a fine of up to $200 for each violation. A transfer of a property where a seller, as an owner, has notinstalled carbon monoxide detectors, when required to do so by law, will not be invalidated, but the seller/owner could be subject todamages of up to $100, plus court costs and attorney fees. Buyer and Seller are each advised to consult with their own homeinspector, contractor or building department to determine the exact location for installation of carbon monoxide detectors. Buyer isadvised to consult with a professional of Buyer's choosing to determine whether the property has carbon monoxide detector(s)installed as required by law, and if not to discuss with their counsel the potential consequences.
4.
LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: Some localities maintain their own retrofit or point of sale requirements which may include therequirement that a carbon monoxide detector be installed prior to a transfer of property. Therefore, it is important to check the localcity or county building and safety departments regarding point of sale or retrofit requirements when transferring property.
