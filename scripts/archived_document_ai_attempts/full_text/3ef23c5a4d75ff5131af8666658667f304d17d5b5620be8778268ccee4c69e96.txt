Eviction note from GPT:
In your situation, given your background of legal disputes and issues with the
landlord and management company, here's a breakdown of your rights based on
California law and tenant protections, including the Tenant Protection Act
(AB1482):
### A. **Change the Day**
Under California law, landlords or management companies are required to provide
"reasonable" notice (usually 24 hours in writing) before entering the unit for things
like inspections, maintenance, or repairs. Since you will be out of state and cannot
reasonably accommodate the original inspection date, you can request to
reschedule to a date when you are available. While the landlord has the right to
access the property for legitimate reasons, they must accommodate reasonable
requests to change the date, especially if it's in good faith.
### B. **Have Your Own Inspector Present**
You have the right to have an independent party (such as your own inspector)
present during the walk-through or inspection. Since this is your home, you can
request that your inspector or representative is there. The presence of a third-
party inspector can also ensure that all issues you need to be addressed are
properly documented.
### C. **Deny the Original Date Due to the Dog**
If you have a large dog that will be on the premises and you are not home, this
could create a safety or liability issue for the management company or
inspectors. It's reasonable to request that the inspection be rescheduled when
you or someone else can be there to manage the dog. Most landlords will agree
to reschedule in such cases, as it’s in their interest to avoid any potential problems
with pets.
### D. **Require a Smaller Time Window**
You can request a more specific or narrow time window for the inspection,
especially if you are paying someone to be there in your absence. California law
doesn't specifically require landlords to narrow the inspection window, but as long
as your request is reasonable, they should try to accommodate it. Providing a
large inspection window can be seen as overly burdensome, particularly if
you’re incurring costs.
### General Recommendations:
1. **Communicate in Writing**: Ensure that all communications with the landlord or
management company are in writing, so you have a record of your requests,
especially if there is a history of disputes.
2. **Legal Counsel**: Since you’re already in a legal dispute, consider consulting
with your attorney to ensure that your rights are fully protected during this
inspection process. They might be able to formally request the changes you want
on your behalf.
3. **HUD and Fair Housing Protections**: Since you have had issues with
discrimination related to an emotional support animal (ESA), HUD protections
under the Fair Housing Act may come into play. Keep a record of any continuing
issues regarding your ESA, especially if it affects how the management company
interacts with you or your property.
If you feel like the management company is being unreasonable, you can escalate
the issue with your attorney or relevant housing authorities.
