Comments: Limited Evaluation
The property was occupied at the the time of inspection. This limits the evaluation of interior
systems such as outlets, windows, closets, cabinets, countertops, flooring materials, and walls.
Beware although our inspector makes every effort to correctly evaluate each interior space,
personal items can conceal material defects.

The interior of the property was inspected and reported on with the above information. While the inspector makes every effort to
find all areas of concern, some areas can go unnoticed. Interior finishes, or stored personal items can limit the evaluation of the
interior areas. Please be aware that the inspector has your best interest in mind. Any repair items mentioned in this report should
be considered before purchase. It is recommended that qualified contractors be used in your further evaluation or repair issues as
it relates to the comments in this inspection report. If a limited evaluation of any area of the interior was made at the time of
inspection, the client is advised to consult a qualified professional to verify the overall condition, prior to the end of the
contingency period. The identification of toxic materials, asbestos, formaldehyde, lead, "Chinese" drywall, mold or other
environmental hazards or conditions is beyond the scope of a home inspection and can only be made in a laboratory. If concerned,
a qualified industrial hygienist should be consulted. Many products used in construction may contain materials that can be toxic/
hazardous. Formaldehyde, lead and asbestos are the most well-known, but other chemicals can be found in varying amounts.
While the use of some of these materials has decreased since the late 1970s; they may still be found, particularly in products
imported from overseas. Further evaluation by sampling of suspect material for undesirable or toxic substances by a qualified
testing laboratory would be prudent. I suggest reading the publication: "Buyers Guide to Earthquake Safety & Environmental
Hazards" available at: http://www.propertyid.com/govbooklets/govenviro.pdf
