REQUEST NO. 9
All DOCUMENTS reflecting any COMPLAINT, criticism, or statement made by
PLAINTIFF or PROPERTY MANAGER CONCERNING DEFENDANT'S habitability
COMPLAINTS or REPAIR REQUESTS.
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE TO REQUEST NO. 9
As part of this meet and confer process, Responding Party requests that Propounding Party
define the term “criticism,” “statement,” “habitability.” Because this request is compound,
Responding Party requests that Propounding Party separate this request into distinct asks.
Additionally, this request seeks confidential, private and/or privileged documents of third parties
not part of the Action, the disclosure of which would violate their right to privacy. This request
seeks information protected by disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product
doctrine and/or information prepared in anticipation of litigation, including physician-patient
privilege. Notwithstanding and without waiving the foregoing objections, Responding Party
responds as follows:
After a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry, Responding Party is unable to comply
with this request because no such document exists or is no longer in possession of Responding
Party. Discovery is ongoing and it is anticipated that additional discovery and further
investigation, legal research and analysis will supply additional facts and provide new and
different meaning to known facts, and may establish new factual conclusions and legal
contentions, all of which may result in additional changes and/or variations from the responses
set herein and Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response at a later time as
appropriate, up to and including at trial.
