Assessment Report #2– Carpeted floor area located in upstairs landing / bedroom#2
Assessed by: Brad Martinez
Assessment Result: A few areas of the floor produced squeaking sounds when walked
over; however, no structural defects were identified.
A squeaky subfloor is not considered a structural issue for several reasons:
1. The Subfloor’s Role in Structural Integrity
The subfloor serves as a supportive layer beneath the flooring, providing a stable base for
the finished surface. While squeaking may indicate minor movement between the subfloor
and other components (like joists or nails), it does not compromise the subfloor’s ability to
maintain its load-bearing function. Its structural integrity remains intact.
2. Common Cause: Friction
Squeaks are typically caused by friction between the subfloor and joists or the nails
holding them together. This is a surface-level issue and does not suggest weakening or
damage to the actual structural framework of the building.
3. No Impact on Stability
While squeaky floors can be annoying, they do not reduce the safety or stability of the
home. The framing and foundation—which are the critical structural elements—are not
aected by the presence of squeaks.
4. Repair Does Not Involve Structural Components
Fixing a squeaky subfloor usually involves resolving the friction or movement causing the
sound, such as securing loose nails or screws, adding adhesive, or placing shims between
gaps. These repairs address the noise but do not involve extensive work on the structure
itself, reairming that squeaks are not structural concerns.
In
summary, a squeaky subfloor is an inconvenience, not a threat to the structural integrity
of the property.
