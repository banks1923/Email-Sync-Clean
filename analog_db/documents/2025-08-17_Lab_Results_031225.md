Fungal Descriptions
Alternaria sp.
Aw - 0.89. Conidia dimensions: 18-83 x 7-18 microns. A very common allergen with an IgE mediated 
response. It is often found in carpets, textiles and on horizontal surfaces in building interiors. Often found 
on window frames. Outdoors it may be isolated from samples of soil, seeds and plants. It is commonly 
found in outdoor samples. The large spore size, 20 - 200 microns in length and 7 - 18 microns in sizes, 
suggests that the spores from these fungi will be deposited in the nose, mouth and upper respiratory 
tract. that the spores from these fungi will be deposited in the nose, mouth and upper respiratory 
tract. It may be related to bakers' asthma. It has been associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
The species Alternaria alternata can produce tenuazonic acid and other toxic metabolites that may be 
associated with disease in humans or animals. Common cause of extrinsic asthma (immediate-type 
hypersensitivity: type I). Acute symptoms include edema and bronchospasms; chronic cases may 
develop pulmonary emphysema.
Ascospore
A spore borne in a special cell called an ascus. Spores of this type are reported to be allergenic. All 
ascomycetes, members of a group of fungi called Ascomycotina, have this type of spore. rgenic. All 
ascomycetes, members of a group of fungi called Ascomycotina, have this type of spore. The minute 
black dots on rotting wood and leaves or the little cups on lichens are examples of ascomycetes; another 
is the "truffle" mushroom.
Aspergillus/Penicillium
These are two of the most commonly found allergenic fungi in problem buildings. Aspergillus comes in 
many varieties (species). Many of the varieties produce toxic substances. It may be associated with 
symptoms such as sinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and other allergic symptoms. 
Penicillium is a variety of mold that is very common indoors and is found in increased numbers in 
problem buildings. It also has many varieties, some of which produce toxic substances. The symptoms 
are allergic reactions, mucous membrane irritation, headaches, vomiting, and diarrhea. he symptoms 
are allergic reactions, mucous membrane irritation, headaches, vomiting, and diarrhea. Due to the 
morphological similarity of  Aspergillus and Penicillium , they are not differentiated by microscopic 
analysis and are reported together.
Aspergillus sp.
Aw 0.75 - 0.82. Reported to be allergenic. Members of this genus are reported to cause ear infections. 
Many species produce mycotoxins that may be associated with disease in humans and other animals. 
Toxin production is dependent on the species or a strain within a species and on the food source for the 
fungus. Some of these toxins have been found to be carcinogenic in animal species. Several toxins are 
considered potential human carcinogens. Common cause of extrinsic asthma (immediate-type 
hypersensitivity: type I). ial human carcinogens. Common cause of extrinsic asthma (immediate-type

Aureobasidium
Aureobasidium pullulans  is a ubiquitous and generalistic black, yeast-like fungus that can be found in different 
environments (e.g., soil, water, air, and limestone). It is well known as a naturally occurring epiphyte or endophyte 
of a wide range of plant species (e.g. apple, grape, cucumber, green beans, cabbage) without causing any symptoms 
of disease.  A. pullulans  has a high importance in biotechnology for the production of different 
enzymes, siderophores and pullulan. Furthermore,  A. biotechnology for the production of different 
enzymes, siderophores and pullulan. Furthermore,  A. pullulans  is used in biological control of plant diseases, 
especially storage diseases. 
Chronic human exposure to  A. pullulans  via humidifiers or air conditioners can lead to 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis) or "humidifier lung". This condition is characterized 
acutely by dyspnea, cough, fever, chest infiltrates, and acute inflammatory reaction. The condition can also be 
chronic, and lymphocyte mediated. The chronic condition is characterized radiographically by reticulonodular 
infiltrates in the lung, with apical sparing. The strains causing infections in humans were reclassified to  A. 
melanogenum.

Rusts/Smuts
These fungi are associated with plant diseases. In the classification scheme of the fungi, the smuts have 
much in common with the rusts, and they are frequently discussed together. Both groups produce wind-
borne, resistant teliospores that serve as the basis for their classification and their means of spread. 
Rusts usually attack vegetative regions (i.e., leaves and stems) of plants; smuts usually are associated 
with the reproductive structures (seeds). They can cause hay fever and asthma.

include coughs, rhinitis, nosebleed, a burning sensation in the nasal passages, throat, and lungs, and 
fever. The toxins produced by this fungus will suppress the immune system affecting the lymphoid tissue 
and the bone marrow. Animals injected with the toxin from this fungus exhibited the following symptoms: 
necrosis and hemorrhage within the brain, thymus, spleen, intestine, lung, heart, lymph node, liver, and 
kidney. emorrhage within the brain, thymus, spleen, intestine, lung, heart, lymph node, liver, and

	 This organism is rarely found in outdoor samples. It is usually difficult to find in indoor air samples 
unless it is physically disturbed (or possibly -this is speculation- a drop in the relative humidity). The 
spores are in a gelatinous mass. Appropriate media for the growth of this organism will have high 
cellulose content and low nitrogen content. The spores will die readily after release. The dead spores are 
still allergenic and toxigenic. Percutaneous absorption has caused mild symptoms.

Tetraploa
Tetraploa  species comprise a very small proportion of the fungal biota. This genus is somewhat related 
to Triposporium  and Diplocladiella. The only reported human infections are two cases of keratitis (1970, 
1980) and one case of subcutaneous infection of the knee (1990). No information is available regarding 
other health effects or toxicity. Allergenicity has not been studied. Usually identified on spore trap 
samples where it is seen every few weeks. (Spores have very distinctive morphology.) Our laboratory 
has never found this organism growing on indoor environmental surfaces. orphology.) Our laboratory

Zygomycetes
Zygomycetes are one of the four major groups of fungi, the others being the Oomycetes, the 
Ascomycetes, and the Basidiomycetes. Zygomycetes are common, fast growing, and often overgrow 
and/or inhibit other fungi nearby. Rhizopus and Mucor are two of the most common Zygomycetes seen 
in the indoor environment. However, others are seen as well, including Syncephalastrum , Circinella ,

General terms
Allergen
An allergen is a substance that elicits an IgE antibody response and is responsible for producing allergic 
reactions. bstance that elicits an IgE antibody response and is responsible for producing allergic 
reactions. Chemicals are released when IgE on certain cells contact an allergen. These chemicals can 
cause injury to surrounding tissue - the visible signs of an allergy. Only a few fungal allergens have been 
characterized but all fungi are thought to be potentially allergenic. Fungal allergens are proteins found in 
either the mycelium or spores
"Black mold"
A poorly defined term. Black mold or toxic black mold has usually been associated with the mold 
Stachybotrys chartarum . While there are only a few molds that are truly black, there are many that can 
appear black. Not all molds that appear to be black are Stachybotrys .
Fungi
Fungi are neither animals nor plants and are classified in a kingdom of their own. The Kingdom of Fungi. are neither animals nor plants and are classified in a kingdom of their own. The Kingdom of Fungi. 
Fungi include a very large group of organisms, including molds, yeasts, mushrooms and puffballs. There 
are >100,000 accepted fungal species but current estimates range to 1.5 million species. Mycologists 
(people who study fungi) have grouped fungi into four large groups according to their method of 
reproduction.
Hidden mold
This refers to visible mold growth on building structures that is not easily seen, including the areas above 
drop ceilings, within a wall cavity (the space between the inner and outer structure of a wall), inside air 
handlers, or within the ducting of a heating/ventilation system.
Microbial Volatile Organic Compounds (MVOCs)
Fungi produce chemicals as a result of their metabolism. crobial Volatile Organic Compounds (MVOCs)
Fungi produce chemicals as a result of their metabolism. Some of these chemicals, MVOCs, are 
responsible for the characteristic moldy, musty, or earthy smell of fungi, whether mushrooms or molds. 
Some MVOCs are considered offensive or annoying. Specific MVOCs are thought to be characteristic of 
wood rot and mold growth on building materials. The human nose is very sensitive to mold odors and 
sometimes more so than current analytical instruments.
Mold
Molds are a group of organisms that belong to the Kingdom of Fungi (see Fungi). Even though the terms 
mold and fungi had been commonly referred to interchangeably, all molds are fungi, but not all fungi are 
molds.

Mycotoxin
Mycotoxins are compounds produced by some fungi that are toxic to humans or animals. By convention, 
the term? Mycotoxin. ds produced by some fungi that are toxic to humans or animals. By convention, 
the term? Mycotoxin. Excludes mushroom toxins. Fungi that produce mycotoxins are called "toxigenic 
fungi.”
Spore
General term for a reproductive structure in fungi, bacteria and some plants. In fungi, the spore is the 
structure which may be used for dissemination and may be resistant to adverse environmental 
conditions.
Toxic mold
The term "toxic mold" has no scientific meaning since the mold itself is not toxic. The metabolic 
byproducts of some molds may be toxic (see mycotoxin).
Hypha (plural, hyphae)
An individual fungal thread or filament of connected cells; the thread that represents the individual parts 
of the fungal body.
