November 14, 2023 – I send Brad and Vicki a text message to let them know that toilet of the 
restroom on the first floor (by the entry way and living room) is leaking a lot of water. I send 2 videos 
and 2 photos in group chat with James, Vicki and Brad. We realize it must be the wax seals and let them 
know that James knows how to fix it but to let us know if they want to come fix it or are okay with us 
fixing it.  
Brad asks us if we tu rned off the water (we did) and states if James is comfortable fixing it then he can 
do that and to let them know of the cost for materials so they can reimburse us.

meantime we are not using th is toilet.  
November 21, 2023 – Plumber from Roto -Rooter comes and quotes $220. James asks if this is 
approved to move forward. Brad confirms it is approved. New wax seals are put in place but afterwards 
the toilet is filling up when flushing. The plumber uses the plunger and it is still clogged. Plumber 
suggests a new toilet because it is old and quotes $650 to James. James relays this information to Brad

have it be appealing. I never canceled maintenance. Sally replied to say she would cancel the

currently working with Lauren to agree on a settlement for the housing discrimination complaint. Which 
is why she is included for transparency. She is aware that the management company has been delaying 
or lacking in making repairs in the unit and advised that I file a retaliation complaint with CRD.  This email 
is to inform all parties that the repair that Lotus requested did not occur and asking for a follow up on 
when it will be rescheduled and repaired.

I also respond to another email thread regarding the mold test which was not conducte d properly. It 
was an air test in which our HEPA air filters were on throughout the home. We have them on 24/7 due 
to my allergies and because we have a dog.
