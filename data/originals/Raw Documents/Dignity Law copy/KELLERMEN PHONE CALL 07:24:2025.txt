Joseph Kellermen   Finally got ahold of our attorney.   3:30 call was scheduled and I was waiting, staring at my phone while in Costco. 2 kids with but my friend was ready to watch the kids. I had the questions regarding the next steps memorized, which sort of summarized the recent events. They were more notes for me to know what I needed to ask and why though.   he never calls so I email politely asking that I be notified if he needs to push it back until a little later (today) so I can stop staring at my phone.  Lawyer emails back sorry 4:00. Ok. So I get the call at 4:03 or so. But he brushes me off so fast  Hey so whats going on well we need a TRO and were wonder… Well why do you think you need a TRO? Because it has been a wild week with them. They have came over 3 times for repairs…. So if you want to stop them blah blah. it’s tricky with landlords and TROs you have to consider how it might not work in your favor. If they win you’ll have to pay their legal fees. I’ll send their lawyer a notice that tells them to knock it off. if they dont heed the warning it’ll strengthen our push for TRO. Ill send that over as soon as you send me over the facts Ok I hear you and that sounds reasonable but I Just want to make sure you have the full picture before you hop off the phone because we need this done asap. Idk if Nora shared with you the summary of issues…. Nora has been working remote all day and I just got out of court. Just send me the stuff We really need this done because… just send them over
