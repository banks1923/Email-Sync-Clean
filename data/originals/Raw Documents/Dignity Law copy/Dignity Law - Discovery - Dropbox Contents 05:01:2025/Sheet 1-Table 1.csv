Defendants breached the Lease by issuing a nonrenewal notice for an ESA (June 19, 2024) and by refusing to repair habitability defects, each constituting a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and implied warranty of habitability; factual basis includes the June 19, 2024 nonrenewal email and landlord’s own statements attributing water damage to preexisting issues .",
