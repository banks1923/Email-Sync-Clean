# Email Thread - Mold Remediation Dispute

## August 14, 2025 - 9:49 AM
**From:** Jen Barreda <jen@yahoo.com>
**Subject:** Documentation

This email is solely for documentation purposes.

This morning, the contractor you scheduled arrived to begin repairs. I confirmed that I was comfortable with the contractor entering the unit to perform the work. However, I explained that I was not comfortable allowing Dean and Brad to enter the unit.

At that point, Dean's demeanor became confrontational and uncooperative. His tone and body language conveyed that he did not intend to leave, and he challenged my decision in a way that felt aggressive and intimidating. Feeling more uncomfortable and concerned, I stated that I would call the police, which I then did. The police confirmed that I am not required to allow Dean and Brad to enter.

Following that confirmation by the police, Dean and Brad decided to end the repairs and leave the property. To be clear, I did not refuse repairs and I did not refuse the contractor's entry. The work did not proceed solely because Dean and Brad chose to stop after being told they could not enter. They left with the repairs undone, leaving mold present and exposed in the unit where our young children reside.

M/M Burbank,

We were not made aware ahead of the scheduled repair today that you intended to block our access to the property. Pursuant to California Civil Code §1954, owners have the legal right to access the property to ensure that repairs are completed properly. Despite this, you refused to allow our presence and contacted law enforcement. For the record, the officers informed us that they did not have the authority to determine our right to enter the property, as the matter is civil in nature rather than criminal. As a result, we elected to pause the repair work. We were unable to confirm any presence of mold given the circumstance of denied entry.

In our continued effort to accommodate and resolve the issues at the property, we intend to proceed with the repairs. We remain committed to ensuring they are completed correctly and in compliance with all applicable standards.

We will post a notice of the repair schedule when confirmed with the contractor.

Pursuant to California Civil Code §1954(a)(2), a landlord or the landlord's agent may enter a dwelling unit for purposes of making necessary or agreed repairs. The statute does not require the landlord's personal presence during those repairs. Authorized entry by the landlord's agent — such as a licensed contractor, repair technician, or other authorized professional — fully satisfies the requirements of §1954.

In this case, we have allowed the authorized repair contractor access to perform the work, and therefore have complied with the statute. Refusing personal entry to Brad and Dean, while allowing entry to the contractor to complete the repairs, is not a violation of §1954. The law permits repair work to be carried out by the landlord's designated agent without the landlord physically attending.

Given that this repair involves visible and exposed mold, it is important that the work be completed as soon as possible to address the associated health and safety concerns.

We also note that physical posting of notices at our door is not necessary under Civil Code §1954 when other reasonable delivery methods, such as email, are available. The recent pattern of physical postings only after we assert our rights feels harassing and retaliatory, and email notice is sufficient to ensure timely receipt and a written record for both parties.

Please let us know when the contractor is available to complete the work, and we will allow entry for the contractor at that time.

M/M Burbank,

In reply to your message below, California Civil Code §1954 does indeed allow for the entry of the landlord or their agent to perform necessary or agreed repairs. While you are correct that the statute does not "require the landlord's personal presence," it explicitly states the right of the landlord to enter. The presence of the landlord's agent does not exclude the presence of the landlord. If that were the case, the code would state as much. The ability to have necessary repairs performed by an agent of the landlord does not prohibit the landlord from carrying out their own requirements. In fact, landlords are obligated to ensure that their agents have properly completed the work assigned.

In this case, a contractor has been selected to perform specific work. There is also a need to inspect the portions of the property which are not typically visible in order to determine if further work may need to be completed. Brad and Dean need to be able to perform this inspection to ensure full compliance.

While the law permits repair work to be carried out by an agent without the landlord's attendance, the landlord's physical attendance is not barred. Should you prefer not to be present when Brad and Dean are exercising their legal right of entry for repair, we can accommodate a time in your schedule where you are away from the property. Your presence is not required for their entry under California law.

Regarding the posting of physical notices, whether or not there are other reasonable alternatives is not determinative of the method selected for providing notice. Pursuant to Civil Code § 1954(d)(1), reasonable notice of an intent to enter shall be given in writing. The plain language of § 1954(d)(1) states, "The notice may be personally delivered to the tenant, left with someone of a suitable age and discretion at the premises, or, left on, near, or under the usual entry door of the premises in a manner in which a reasonable person would discover the notice." Your willingness to accept notice by electronic mail does not negate our ability to provide notice in compliance with the method described in the Code.

Ensuring that we sufficiently meet our legal obligations is not harassing or retaliatory. While it is also true that written notice is not required when an agreement has been reached, such as with an oral agreement as described in § 1954(d)(3), a physical posting on the door is still allowed and ensures Code compliance. Posting notice of entry at the doorway is in no way meant to harass or retaliate but is done to make sure that we have sufficiently met the notice requirements.

Please let us know if you would like any further clarification on this matter.

As we have not had a response from you regarding the schedule offered below, no inspection or removal of any exposed mold will take place this weekend.

We will determine the next opportunity to schedule work and notify you as required.

When you have a solution that does not involve the obvious conflict of interest in Dean serving as "certified mold inspector," please let us know. We are eager for you to resolve the exposed flooring and uncovered mold.

Given the well-documented health risks mold poses to children, I hope you have a better solution in mind.

This could have been avoided if not for, and I quote, "we ELECTED to pause the repair work."

We are continuing to document these conditions daily and will pursue all remedies available. I've attached CDC guidance on mold assessment and remediation that may help.

Best regards,
James Burbank

In response to the email sent on August 14 at 10:54pm:

I acknowledge that we have a different interpretation of Civil Code §1954. I am not going to continue debating the statute by email, but I do maintain that nothing requires the landlords personally to be present for repairs so long as their authorized contractors have entry.

Regarding your choice to post physical notices, I have never said you cannot post. My concern is the pattern, notices are posted only after we assert our rights, whereas nearly all other communications (including repair schedules and entry notices) are sent by email. That timing and selective use of physical posting causes us to feel harassed and retaliated against. I am asking that you refrain from using physical posting in this manner and instead continue using email, except where the law strictly requires otherwise.

We continue to allow and welcome authorized contractors to perform the necessary work.

M/M Burbank,

As tenants are not the owners of the property, they do not have a say in who performs necessary repairs. Dean is a certified inspector and mold removal specialist. As such, he is qualified to perform this work. It is not a reasonable objection that you believe that he would allow a perceived conflict of interest to influence the results of the work he is certified to do. Dean assists with the management of the property and can perform work in the same way that any member of the maintenance team, or any other third-party contractor hired by management can.

As we have informed you, it is the duty of the property owner and managers to perform necessary repairs. It is the discretion of the owners and managers to use the employed staff or any contractor they choose to complete the necessary work. Any argument as to a perceived conflict of interest, which does not exist, could just as easily be alleged against any employee or contractor. Likewise, the same argument could be made for any individual the tenant chooses to hire. We simply wish to have the work performed as quickly as possible. Dean is certified in this area and best situated to remedy any potential issue as quickly as possible, which is in the best interest of all involved.

It is our decision to have Dean perform this work, and it is our right and responsibility to determine who will perform the repairs.

We are not refusing repairs. But under Civil Code §1954, a landlord may only enter for a lawful purpose. Since litigation over habitability and mold is currently pending, sending the landlord's spouse (Dean Houser) into the unit for another "inspection" is not a lawful purpose. It risks spoliation of evidence, tampering with, destroying, or concealing evidence, and interferes directly with the ongoing judicial process and our rights as tenants in lawful possession.

Additionally, a neutral, certified mold inspector has already tested and issued a written report, which has been in your possession for several weeks. That report recommended professional mold remediation. You have chosen not to act on this recommendation from a neutral, licensed professional.

The standard of care for remediation has already been established in that report. The next step is professional remediation, not another "inspection" by the landlord's spouse, who is not neutral and has a direct interest in the outcome.

If you disagree with the independent findings we provided, the appropriate option is to hire your own neutral licensed professional. What is not appropriate is sending the landlord's spouse to re-inspect or remediate, which would not be impartial, would fall below the accepted standard of care, and would compromise evidence.

For these reasons, we cannot consent to entry by the landlord's spouse (Dean Houser). We will cooperate with remediation performed by a licensed, neutral professional in compliance with state law and the Health & Safety Code.

Ms. Garcia,

For your records, we were denied entry to the property today by Mr. & Mrs. Burbank.

Dean and Brad arrived at 3:00PM, the stated time on the 24-hour notice to enter.

Dean is our property manager and licensed mold inspector & removal specialist. Brad is a property owner and has the legal right to enter as such.

Mrs. Burbank also sent the email below stating their opposition to our scheduled plan to enter, assess, and remediate as we are legally required to do as owners.
