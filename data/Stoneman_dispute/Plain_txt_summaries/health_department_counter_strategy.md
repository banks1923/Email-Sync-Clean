# Health Department Counter-Strategy: Surgical Response to Stoneman's False Narrative

## Executive Summary

This document provides a phased strategy to counter Stoneman Staff's misleading "denied entry" narrative presented to the health department. The approach builds legal credibility, exposes systematic identity avoidance, and presents factual evidence of accountability evasion.

## **PHASE 1A: INVALID NOTICE (Credibility Foundation)**

### Legal Defects in 08/18/2025 Notice

**Critical Failures:**
- Illegible signature with no printed name
- Generic "Owner/Agent" designation 
- Impossible to verify authority of signatory

### Applicable Civil Codes
- California Civil Code ยง1962 (disclosure requirements)
- California Civil Code ยง1954 (entry procedures)  
- California Health & Safety Code (habitability standards)

### Legal Conclusion
Notice fails basic legal requirements for valid entry authorization.

## **PHASE 1B: EXPOSE THE FACADE FOR DPH**

### Pattern of Systematic Identity Avoidance

**Statistical Evidence:**
- **93 emails** from "Stoneman Staff" (100% collective signatures)
- **88 transparency requests** ignored by tenants
- **0% response rate** to identification demands

### Their Own Admission
**Direct Quote** (May 29, 2025):
> *"There is no legal requirement to communicate in the manner you have mandated"*

### The Contradiction Exposed

**When Convenient:**
- **August 18, 2025**: Can sign as "Dean, Brad, Gail & Vicki" 

**When Accountability Required:**
- **All other times**: Hide behind "Stoneman Staff"

### Key Question for DPH
If they can identify themselves individually, why do they refuse when accountability is needed?

## **PHASE 1D: GUILTY AND AVOIDING ACCOUNTABILITY**
*Drive-by factual finish*

### Timeline Facts

**Before March 1, 2025:**
- Individual signatures common (Gail: 23 emails)
- Normal identification patterns

**March 1, 2025:**
- Tenant raises concerns about recording inside home with children present

**After March 1, 2025:**
- "Stoneman Staff" signatures dominate (47 vs 17 individual)
- Dramatic shift in identification patterns

### Pattern Shift Evidence

**Systematic Changes:**
- Individual names used only sparingly since recording incident
- Notices, emails, and repair visits all lack individual identification
- Harassment pattern intensified after accountability questions raised

### Legal Foundation

**Civil Code ยง1962 exists for exactly this reason** - to prevent landlords from hiding behind collective identities when individual accountability is required.

---

## **Tactical Execution Notes**

### Strategic Principles
1. **Build legal credibility** without showing all cards
2. **Expose contradictions** using their own words  
3. **End with factual timeline** that speaks for itself
4. **Never accuse** - present facts that lead to obvious conclusion

### Psychological Approach
- Make health department connect dots rather than appearing argumentative
- Let their own statements and patterns speak to evasion
- Present as systematic legal violations, not personal disputes

### Expected Outcome
Health department recognizes this isn't simple "landlord rights" but systematic avoidance of legal requirements and professional standards.
