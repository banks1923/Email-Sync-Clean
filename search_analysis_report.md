### 3. Stoneman Staff's Identity Explanation
**Finding**: After months of requests, Stoneman Staff provided **one explanation** about their identity  
**Response Rate**: Only **4 of 93 emails (4.3%)** addressed the identity question

#### The Team Identification (June 2, 2025):
> **"Brad, Dean, Gail, and Vicki- the Stoneman Staff- are committed to addressing your tenant needs and will continue to work to that end, with your cooperation. The email messages from 518stoneman@gmail.com support our alignment as a team in taking care of you as our tenants and the rental unit itself."**

#### Team Alignment Explanation (May 29, 2025):
> **"Brad, Dean, Gail, and Vicki have consistently worked together, maintaining regular communication throughout your tenancy to ensure alignment across our team."**

#### Statistics:
- **Team members identified**: Brad, Dean, Gail, and Vicki
- **Emails with explanations**: 4 out of 93 (4.3%)
- **Dates of explanations**: May 29, June 2, and June 11, 2025
- **Months before identification**: 3 months (March-May with no names)
- **Months after identification**: 2+ months continuing with "Stoneman Staff"

#### Analysis:
Despite providing names once, they:
- **Never specified** which individual wrote each email
- **Maintained collective signature** for remaining 50+ emails
- **Ignored further requests** for individual accountability
- **Emphasized team alignment** over individual responsibility

The explanation reveals they view themselves as a collective decision-making body where individual accountability is intentionally obscured behind the "Stoneman Staff" identity.
