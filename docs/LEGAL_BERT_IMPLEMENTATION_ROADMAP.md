# Legal BERT Implementation Roadmap 🎯

**Project:** OCR Legal Document Processing System  
**Enhancement:** Semantic Processing with Legal BERT  
**Date:** 2025-08-27

## Executive Summary

Your OCR system currently uses **regex-based boilerplate detection** achieving 52.8% text reduction. Adding **Legal BERT semantic processing** will provide:

- **Semantic boilerplate removal** (complementary to regex)
- **Legal entity extraction** (parties, statutes, case numbers)
- **Timeline auto-generation** from document events
- **Semantic search capabilities** with query expansion
- **Document clustering** and similarity detection
- **Structured metadata** for litigation intelligence

**ROI:** Transforms manual document analysis into automated legal intelligence.

- ✅ **85,934 lines extracted** with proper formatting  
- ✅ **Regex boilerplate removal** working (52.8% reduction)
- ✅ **Google Document AI** integration operational
- ✅ **Clean text output** with preserved legal structure

**Gap:** No semantic processing - missing entity extraction, timeline detection, and legal intelligence.
