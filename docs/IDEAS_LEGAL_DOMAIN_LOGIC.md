# ⚠️ IDEAS ONLY - DO NOT IMPLEMENT WITHOUT REVIEW ⚠️

**WARNING: This is a collection of potentially useful code/concepts extracted from a refactoring session. These are NOT production-ready and need proper design, testing, and review before any implementation.**

_Context: These functions were removed from `infrastructure/mcp_servers/legal_intelligence_mcp.py` during refactoring but contain domain knowledge that might be valuable if properly reimplemented._

## Legal Document Sequence Knowledge

### Concept: Expected Document Sequences by Case Type
Different legal case types follow predictable document sequences. This knowledge could help identify missing documents or predict next steps.

```python
# PSEUDOCODE - DO NOT USE AS-IS
CASE_DOCUMENT_SEQUENCES = {
    "unlawful_detainer": [
        "complaint",
        "summons", 
        "answer",
        "motion",
        "order",
        "judgment",
        "notice"
    ],
    "civil_litigation": [
        "complaint",
        "summons",
        "answer",
        "discovery",
        "motion",
        "brief",
        "order",
        "judgment"
    ],
    "contract": [
        "complaint",
        "answer",
        "discovery",
        "motion",
        "brief",
        "settlement",
        "order"
    ],
    "family_law": [
        "petition",
        "response",
        "discovery",
        "motion",
        "order",
        "settlement",
        "judgment"
    ]
}
```

### Concept: Missing Document Prediction
Based on existing documents and case type, predict what might be missing:

```python
# IDEA ONLY - Needs proper implementation
def predict_missing_documents(existing_docs, case_type):
    """
    Compare existing documents against expected sequence.
    
    Considerations for proper implementation:
    - Use confidence scoring based on case progression
    - Consider that not all documents are always required
    - Account for variations in different jurisdictions
    - Should integrate with timeline to understand case stage
    """
    pass
```

### Concept: Case Type Detection
Determine case type from document content:

```python
# CONCEPTUAL - Needs NLP/ML approach
def determine_case_type(documents):
    """
    Ideas for implementation:
    - Use spaCy's pattern matcher with legal patterns
    - Train classifier on known case types
    - Look for specific legal language patterns:
      * "unlawful detainer" → eviction case
      * "dissolution of marriage" → divorce
      * "breach of contract" → contract dispute
    - Consider hierarchical classification (broad → specific)
    """
    pass
```

## Legal Document Patterns

### Concept: Document Type Recognition Patterns
```python
# REFERENCE ONLY - Needs proper pattern matching
LEGAL_DOC_PATTERNS = {
    "complaint": ["complaint", "petition", "initial filing"],
    "answer": ["answer", "response", "reply"],
    "motion": ["motion", "request", "application"],
    "order": ["order", "ruling", "judgment", "decree"],
    "discovery": ["interrogatories", "deposition", "request for production"],
    "notice": ["notice", "summons", "subpoena"],
    "brief": ["brief", "memorandum", "argument"],
    "settlement": ["settlement", "agreement", "stipulation"],
    "transcript": ["transcript", "hearing", "proceedings"]
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

### If These Ideas Are Pursued:

1. **Use Proper NLP**
   - Replace keyword matching with spaCy patterns
   - Consider training custom NER for legal document types
   - Use sentence transformers for semantic similarity

2. **Make Configurable**
   - Move patterns to YAML/JSON config files
   - Allow jurisdiction-specific variations
   - Support custom case types

3. **Add Statistical Confidence**
   - Don't use hardcoded confidence values
   - Calculate based on actual data patterns
   - Consider case timeline and progression

4. **Integrate with Existing Services**
   - Should complement TimelineService, not duplicate
   - Use EntityService for party identification
   - Leverage embedding service for similarity

5. **Consider Creating `lib/legal/` Module**
   - `case_analyzer.py` - Case type and stage detection
   - `document_patterns.py` - Legal document recognition
   - `sequence_predictor.py` - Missing document prediction

## Why These Might Be Valuable

- **Domain Knowledge**: Legal procedures follow patterns that generic NLP doesn't understand
- **User Value**: Helping identify missing documents could prevent legal issues
- **Not Elsewhere**: This specific legal knowledge doesn't exist in EntityService or TimelineService

## Why They Were Removed

- **Poor Implementation**: Used naive string matching
- **No Tests**: Couldn't verify if they worked correctly
- **Hardcoded Values**: Not configurable or adaptable
- **Duplicated Effort**: Some functionality existed elsewhere
