# ü§ñ AI-Powered Hybrid Vector Search CLI (`scripts/vsearch`)

## Overview
The `scripts/vsearch` command provides an AI-powered hybrid search interface that combines Legal BERT semantic understanding with traditional keyword matching for intelligent email discovery.

## üß† How It Works

### Hybrid Intelligence
1. **Semantic Search First**: Uses Legal BERT Large model (1024D) to understand query meaning
2. **Intelligent Fallback**: Falls back to keyword search if AI unavailable
3. **Natural Language**: Accepts plain English queries like "water damage issues"
4. **High Accuracy**: Achieves 0.88-0.94 similarity scores for relevant matches

### AI Model Details
- **Model**: `pile-of-law/legalbert-large-1.7M-2` (Legal domain optimized)
- **Dimensions**: 1024-dimensional embeddings
- **Processing**: Local inference, no API costs
- **Performance**: ~2-3 seconds per query including model loading

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check system status
scripts/vsearch info

# Process emails for AI search (required first time)
scripts/vsearch process -n 50

# Search with natural language
scripts/vsearch search "water damage problems"
scripts/vsearch search "financial planning meeting"
scripts/vsearch search "urgent attention needed"
```

## Commands

### `scripts/vsearch search "query"`
AI-powered hybrid search combining semantic similarity with keyword matching.

```bash
# Natural language queries
scripts/vsearch search "password reset issues"
scripts/vsearch search "property maintenance problems"
scripts/vsearch search "budget planning discussions"

# With custom result limit
scripts/vsearch search "server errors" --limit 10
```

**Output Format:**
```
ü§ñ AI-Powered Hybrid Search for: 'water damage issues'
üîç Running semantic similarity search...
‚úÖ Found 3 semantic matches

### `scripts/vsearch process [-n NUMBER]`
Generate AI embeddings for emails to enable semantic search.

```bash
# Process all unprocessed emails
scripts/vsearch process

# Process specific number
scripts/vsearch process -n 50    # Process 50 emails
scripts/vsearch process -n 394   # Process all emails (if you have 394 total)
```

**Processing Output:**

```bash
scripts/vsearch info
```

```

## Search Examples

### Property Management Queries
```bash
# These queries demonstrate AI semantic understanding
scripts/vsearch search "water damage issues"        # Finds: plumbing, leaks, maintenance
scripts/vsearch search "property maintenance"       # Finds: repairs, notices, inspections
scripts/vsearch search "financial discussions"      # Finds: budgets, costs, payments
scripts/vsearch search "urgent attention needed"    # Finds: alerts, problems, deadlines
```

### Technical Queries
```bash
scripts/vsearch search "system errors"             # Finds: bugs, failures, issues
scripts/vsearch search "server maintenance"        # Finds: downtime, updates, repairs
scripts/vsearch search "database problems"         # Finds: connectivity, performance issues
```

### Business Queries
```bash
scripts/vsearch search "meeting schedules"         # Finds: appointments, planning, coordination
scripts/vsearch search "project updates"           # Finds: progress, status, reports
scripts/vsearch search "customer feedback"         # Finds: reviews, complaints, suggestions
```

## Understanding Results

### Similarity Scores
- **0.90-1.00**: Extremely similar content (near-exact semantic match)
- **0.85-0.90**: Very similar content (highly related topics)
- **0.80-0.85**: Similar content (related concepts)
- **0.75-0.80**: Moderately similar (some conceptual overlap)
- **Below 0.75**: Low similarity (filtered out by default)

### Search Types
- **üß† Semantic Similarity**: AI found conceptually related emails using Legal BERT
- **üî§ Keyword Match**: Traditional full-text search found exact word matches
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback**: AI unavailable, using keyword search only

## Advanced Usage

### Python API Integration
```python
from vector_service import VectorService

# Initialize AI-powered search
service = VectorService()

# Natural language search
results = service.search_similar("water damage issues", limit=5)

# Process results
if results["success"] and results.get("data"):
    for email in results["data"]:
        score = email.get("score", 0)
        print(f"Score: {score:.3f} - {email['subject']}")
```

### Batch Processing
```bash
# Process emails in batches for large datasets
scripts/vsearch process -n 25    # Small batch
scripts/vsearch process -n 100   # Medium batch
scripts/vsearch process -n 500   # Large batch (may take time)
```

### System Integration
```bash
# Check if AI search is ready
scripts/vsearch info | grep "AI Embeddings"

# Automated processing check
if scripts/vsearch info | grep -q "Pending Processing: 0"; then
    echo "AI search fully operational"
else
    echo "Run scripts/vsearch process to enable full AI search"
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Semantic search unavailable"
```bash
# Check system status
scripts/vsearch info

# Process emails to enable AI search
scripts/vsearch process -n 50

# Verify Legal BERT model loading
python3 -c "from vector_service import VectorService; s=VectorService(); print('AI Status:', s.validation_result)"
```

#### No Results Found
```bash
# Check email database
sqlite3 emails.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emails;"

# Try broader search terms
scripts/vsearch search "hello"          # Should find greeting emails
scripts/vsearch search "email"          # Should find emails containing "email"
```

#### Processing Errors
```bash
# Check logs for errors
tail -f logs/vector_service_$(date +%Y%m%d).log

# Try smaller batch size
scripts/vsearch process -n 5

# Check system resources
scripts/vsearch info
```

### Performance Tips

#### Search Optimization
- **Be specific**: "quarterly financial report" better than "report"
- **Use context**: "server down production" better than "server"
- **Combine concepts**: "customer feedback product roadmap"

#### Processing Optimization
- **Start small**: Process 10-20 emails first to test
- **Monitor resources**: Large batches use more CPU/memory
- **Process incrementally**: Run regular small batches vs one large batch
