# NLP System Status Report

Generated: 2025-01-05

## Executive Summary

The NLP system is **PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL** with significant components working but not fully integrated into the main workflow.

## Component Status

### 1. SpaCy NER (Entity Extraction) ✅ WORKING

**Status**: Fully operational
**Version**: SpaCy 3.8.7
**Model**: en_core_web_sm loaded successfully

**Capabilities**:
- 18 entity types supported (PERSON, ORG, GPE, DATE, MONEY, etc.)
- Entity normalization available
- Relationship extraction available
- Database storage implemented

**Issues**:
- Not integrated into vsearch CLI
- EntityService missing some expected methods (is_ready)
- Located at: `entity/` module

### 2. Legal BERT Embeddings ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Status**: Model loads but not used in production
**Model**: nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased
**Dimensions**: 768 (not 1024 as documented)

**Issues**:
- vsearch reports "Using mock embedding service"
- Model available but not connected to main search pipeline
- Fallback to all-MiniLM-L6-v2 configured
- Located at: `lib/embeddings.py`

### 3. Document Summarization ✅ WORKING

**Status**: Fully implemented but not integrated
**Capabilities**:
- TF-IDF keyword extraction
- TextRank sentence extraction
- Combined summarization

**Classes**:
- `TFIDFSummarizer` - Keyword extraction
- `TextRankSummarizer` - Sentence ranking
- `DocumentSummarizer` - Orchestrates both

**Issues**:
- Not exposed via CLI
- Method is `extract_summary()` not `summarize()`
- Located at: `summarization/engine.py`

### 4. Legal Intelligence Service ✅ WORKING

**Status**: Operational via MCP server
**Capabilities**:
- Timeline analysis
- Legal entity extraction
- Knowledge graph generation

**Issues**:
- Missing implementations noted with TODOs:
  - `_extract_dates_from_document()` - removed
  - `_identify_timeline_gaps()` - removed
  - `_calculate_document_similarity()` - removed
  - `_extract_themes()` - removed
  - `_detect_anomalies()` - removed

### 5. Search Intelligence Integration ❌ NOT INTEGRATED

**Current State**:
- Semantic search uses mock embeddings
- Hybrid search with RRF implemented
- Legal BERT model available but not connected

**Root Cause**:
```bash
# vsearch admin health shows:
EMBEDDINGS -> mock
  Model: None (loaded=None)
```

## Key Problems

### 1. Integration Gap
NLP components exist and work independently but aren't wired into the main search/CLI workflow.

### 2. Mock Embeddings in Production
Despite Legal BERT being available, the system uses mock embeddings:
- `lib/embeddings.py` has the model
- `vsearch` doesn't use it
- Search results are not semantically ranked

### 3. Missing CLI Commands
No CLI exposure for:
- Entity extraction
- Document summarization
- Legal intelligence features

### 4. Dimensional Mismatch
Documentation claims 1024D embeddings but Legal BERT provides 768D.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix (High Priority)
1. Connect Legal BERT to vsearch embedding pipeline
2. Fix mock embedding service issue
3. Verify vector dimensions (768 vs 1024)

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Add CLI commands for entity extraction
2. Expose summarization via vsearch
3. Implement missing legal_intelligence functions

### Medium Term (This Month)
1. Create unified NLP pipeline
2. Integrate entity extraction into search workflow
3. Add entity-based search filtering

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test entity extraction
python3 -c "from entity.main import EntityService; 
svc = EntityService(); 
result = svc.extract_entities('text with entities')"

# Test embeddings
python3 -c "from lib.embeddings import get_embedding_service; 
svc = get_embedding_service(); 
vec = svc.encode('test text')"

# Test summarization
python3 -c "from summarization.engine import DocumentSummarizer;
s = DocumentSummarizer();
result = s.extract_summary('long text here')"
```

## Conclusion

The NLP infrastructure is **built but not connected**. All major components work in isolation but need integration into the main workflow. The most critical issue is the mock embedding service preventing semantic search from working properly.
