From: jenbarreda@yahoo.com To: brad_martinez@att.net Subject: Re: August 14, 2025 Repair Date: 2025-08-18T-ï»¿We are not refusing repairs. But under Civil Code Â§1954, a landlord may only enter for a lawful purpose. Since litigation over habitability and mold is currently pending, sending the landlordâ€™s spouse (Dean Houser) into the unit for another â€œinspectionâ€ is not a lawful purpose. It risks spoliation of evidence, tampering with, destroying, or concealing evidence, and interferes directly with the ongoing judicial process and our rights as tenants in lawful possession.Additionally, a neutral, certified mold inspector has already tested and issued a written report, which has been in your possession for several weeks. That report recommended professional mold remediation. You have chosen not to act on this recommendation from a neutral, licensed professional.The standard of care for remediation has already been established in that report. The next step is professional remediation, not another â€œinspectionâ€ by the landlordâ€™s spouse, who is not neutral and has a direct interest in the outcome.If you disagree with the independent findings we provided, the appropriate option is to hire your own neutral licensed professional. What is not appropriate is sending the landlordâ€™s spouse to re-inspect or remediate, which would not be impartial, would fall below the accepted standard of care, and would compromise evidence.For these reasons, we cannot consent to entry by the landlordâ€™s spouse (Dean Houser). We will cooperate with remediation performed by a licensed, neutral professional in compliance with state law and the Health & Safety Code.On Aug 18, 2025, at , Stoneman wrote:ï»¿M/M Burbank, As tenants are not the owners of the property, they do not have a say in who performs necessary repairs. Dean is a certified inspector and mold removal specialist. As such, he is qualified to perform this work. It is not a reasonable objection that you believe that he would allow a perceived conflict of interest to influence the results of the work he is certified to do. Dean assists with the management of the property and can perform work in the same way that any member of the maintenance team, or any other third-party contractor hired by management can. As we have informed you, it is the duty of the property owner and managers to perform necessary repairs. It is the discretion of the owners and managers to use the employed staff or any contractor they choose to complete the necessary work. Any argument as to a perceived conflict of interest, which does not exist, could just as easily be alleged against any employee or contractor. Likewise, the same argument could be made for any individual the tenant chooses to hire. We simply wish to have the work performed as quickly as possible. Dean is certified in this area and best situated to remedy any potential issue as quickly as possible, which is in the best interest of all involved. It is our decision to have Dean perform this work, and it is our right and responsibility to determine who will perform the repairs.

From: jenbarreda@yahoo.com To: brad_martinez@att.net Subject: Re: August 14, 2025 Repair Date: 2025-08-16T-In response to the email sent on August 14 at :I acknowledge that we have a different interpretation of Civil Code Â§1954. I am not going to continue debating the statute by email, but I do maintain that nothing requires the landlords personally to be present for repairs so long as their authorized contractors have entry.Regarding your choice to post physical notices, I have never said you cannot post. My concern is the pattern, notices are posted only after we assert our rights, whereas nearly all other communications (including repair schedules and entry notices) are sent by email. That timing and selective use of physical posting causes us to feel harassed and retaliated against. I am asking that you refrain from using physical posting in this manner and instead continue using email, except where the law strictly requires otherwise.We continue to allow and welcome authorized contractors to perform the necessary work.On Aug 16, 2025, at , James Burbank wrote:ï»¿To Brad, Dean, Gail, and Vicki When you have a solution that does not involve the obvious conflict of interest in Dean serving as â€œcertified mold inspector,â€ please let us know.
