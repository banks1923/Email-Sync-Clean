Blue Ribbon Property Inspections Burbank The interior of the property was inspected
and reported on with the above information.
While the inspector makes every effort to find all areas of concern, some areas can
go unnoticed.
Interior finishes, or stored personal items can limit the evaluation of the interior
areas.
Please be aware that the inspector has your best interest in mind.
Any repair items mentioned in this report should be considered before purchase.
It is recommended that qualified contractors be used in your further evaluation or
repair issues as it relates to the comments in this inspection report.
If a limited evaluation of any area of the interior was made at the time of inspection
, the client is advised to consult a qualified professional to verify the overall
condition, prior to the end of the contingency period.
The identification of toxic materials, asbestos, formaldehyde, lead, " Chinese
" drywall, mold or other environmental hazards or conditions is beyond the scope
of a home inspection and can only be made in a laboratory.
If concerned, a qualified industrial hygienist should be consulted.
Many products used in construction may contain materials that can be toxic / hazardous
.
Formaldehyde, lead and asbestos are the most well - known, but other chemicals can
be found in varying amounts.
While the use of some of these materials has decreased since the late 1970s;
they may still be found, particularly in products imported from overseas.
Further evaluation by sampling of suspect material for undesirable or toxic substances
by a qualified testing laboratory would be prudent.
