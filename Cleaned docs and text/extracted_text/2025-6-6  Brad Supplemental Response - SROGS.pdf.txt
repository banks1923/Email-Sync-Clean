1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT These responses are
made only for the purpose of the within action.
Each response or answer is subject to all objections as to competence, relevance
, materiality, propriety, admissibility and any other objections and grounds that
would require the exclusion of any statement herein if any document was asked of,
or if any statement contained therein were made by a witness present and testifying
in court, all of which objections and grounds are reserved and may be interposed
at the time of trial.
Plaintiff is responding to all Requests to the extent that information has become
known by him.
However, this responding party's discovery, investigation and preparation for trial
of this matter has not been completed as of the date of these responses, and, therefore
, Plaintiff does not purport to state anything more than information presently known
and discovered by him.
Plaintiff, in responding to these Requests, reserves the right to continue discovery
and investigation in this matter for facts, witnesses and supporting data that may
recall information which, if he had presently within his knowledge, would be included
in these responses.
For 18 example, to the extent that any request calls for the identification of ‘
all documents, ” it is responded 19 to fully insofar as information is presently
available to Plaintiff, and Plaintiff is not precluded from This preliminary statement
is incorporated into each of the responses set forth below.
GENERAL OBJECTIONS 20 presenting at trial information discovered after the date of
the response of this request.
21 22 23 24 25 122 26 27 28 To avoid repetition in setting forth specific objections
to interrogatories, responding party sets forth and incorporates the following objections
to responding party's each and every response.
A.
RELEVENCY OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory,
in whole or in part, seek the PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO DEFENDANT'S REQUESTS
FOR SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES -2

--- Page 3 ---
1 disclosure of information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of the
action nor reasonably 2 calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence
.
3 B.
CONFIDENTIALITY / PRIVACY OBJECTION 4 5 Responding party objects on the basis that
the interrogatory seeks the disclosure of confidential 6 information and constitute
an attempt to invade the personal and / or financial privacy of certain 7 individuals
or persons.
8 C.
OVERBREADTH AND BURDEN OBJECTION 9 10 11 Responding party objects on the basis that
the interrogatory is overbroad, burdensome and oppressive in that they seek the disclosure
of information that has little or no practical benefit to 12 propounding party while
placing an unwarranted burden or expense on the responding party in 13 14 15 16 17
ascertaining such information.
Further, such interrogatory is so broadly drawn that although it may include some
relevant information within its scope, it includes information that is irrelevant
or immaterial to the instant action.
Such interrogatory seeks information which is cumulative and / or would require the
compilation of extensive and detailed information from numerous 18 potential sources
, many of which is not easily identifiable or available.
A search for all such 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 information will in many instances involve
enormous amounts of time by responding party.
Further, the interrogatory is so overbroad such that it is uncertain what information
is sought.
D.
AMBIGUITY OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is
phrased in language that is vague, ambiguous, and uncertain such that responding
party is unable to ascertain what information is sought and in order to respond to
this interrogatory, responding party would have to speculate as to propounding party's
intended meaning.
26 27 28 E.
AVAILABILITY OBJECTION PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO DEFENDANT'S REQUESTS
FOR SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES - 3

--- Page 4 ---
1 2 Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is equally accessible
to all parties or is more accessible to the propounding party or which is maintained
primarily by persons or 3 entities other than responding party.
4 F.
IMPROPER FORM OBJECTION 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Responding
party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is phrased in improper form because
the interrogatory is not “ full and complete in and of itself ";
or because it contains subpart, " compound, conjunctive or disjunctive ” question
, such that the interrogatory does not comply with the requirements of California
Code of Civil Procedure §2030.060 G.
LEGAL CONCLUSION OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
calls for a legal conclusion.
H.
ATTORNEY WORK - PRODUCT OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
, in whole or in part, seeks disclosure of information that is protected under the
attorney work - product doctrine.
I.
MARITAL PRIVILEGE OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the request
, in whole or in part, seek disclosure of information that is protected under marital
privilege.
