Burbank v.
Martinez Claim No.: 18H5974 Our File No.: 2304-0049 Date of Loss: 11/25/2024 SECOND
MEET AND CONFER RE PLAINTIFFS ' DISCOVERY RESPONSES Dear Counsel: Please be advised
that Plaintiffs ' responses to Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production are
deficient as set forth below.
Please note that this is our second attempt to meet and confer on the issues raised
in this letter.
As you know, we have pending motions to compel already on file with the Court.
A.
Responses to Form Interrogatories Plaintiffs have failed to provide substantive responses
to validly issued, judicially approved form interrogatories.
" Misuses of the discovery process include but are not limited to...
(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.
" Code Civ.
Proc.
§ 2023.010 (d).
The failure to provide complete responses to these interrogatories constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process.
Further, the plaintiffs have a duty to provide " complete " answers.
Each answer in the response must be " as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably available to the responding party permits.
If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be answered to the extent
possible.
" (CCP § 2030.220 (a), (b) (emphasis added).
) False or evasive responses are improper.
Indeed, an evasive response is grounds for sanctions.

Re: Burbank v Martinez June 26, 2025 1.
Jennifer Burbank's Responses Jennifer's response to Form Interrogatory 12.3 is incomplete
as it does not provide a date for the statements obtained.
A range is not an appropriate response.
The response to Form Interrogatory 12.4 is incomplete and evasive.
The interrogatory specifically asks for the dates taken.
Providing a 20 - month potential range is insufficient.
The response to 12.6 is similarly deficient in that the entire call of the interrogatory
is not responded to.
The subsections (a) and (b) are not responded to.
As such, please provide (a) the name, title, identification number, and employer
of the PERSON who made the report;
and (b) the date and type of report made.
As to Form Interrogatories 14.1 and 14.2, please respond to the entire question.
14.1 specifically asks for the statute, ordinance, or regulation that was violated
.
As with 14.2, subsection (b) remains unanswered.
With respect to 17.1, the response provided subsection (d) provides inadequate
information with respect to the documentation supporting the responses.
For example, stating that supporting documents include “ text messages " without
further specification (or identification by an exhibit number or bates range) does
not provide enough information to identify these documents.
Please supplement this response.
2.
James Burbank's Responses As to Form Interrogatory 2.5 (c), the response states
that James lived at the subject unit from 09/08/2030 to the present.
This appears to be a clerical error, but please confirm.
James did not provide a complete response to Form Interrogatory 2.6 (b).
The interrogatory clearly requests the dates of employment, the job title, and nature
of work for each employer you have had from five years before the INCIDENT until today
.
Please provide the outstanding additional information.
With respect to Form Interrogatory 6.5 (c), James states that he bought Ibuprofen
in October 2025.
Again, this appears to be a clerical error, however, please confirm.
The responses to Form Interrogatories 12.1-12.3 appear to be evasive.
It is unbelievable that there are no witnesses to the incident.
While it is possible that there were no interviews, the videos provided include recorded
statements of different individuals.
The response to Form Interrogatory 12.4 is incomplete and evasive.
The interrogatory specifically asks for the dates taken.
Providing a 20 - month potential range is insufficient.
The response to 12.6 is similarly deficient in that the entire call of the interrogatory
is not responded to.
The subsections (a) and (b) are not responded to.
As 2

Re: Burbank v Martinez June 26, 2025 such, please provide (a) the name, title
, identification number, and employer of the PERSON who made the report;
and (b) the date and type of report made.
As to Form Interrogatories 14.1 and 14.2, please respond to the entire question.
14.1 specifically asks for the statute, ordinance, or regulation that was violated
.
As with 14.2, subsection (b) remains unanswered.
With respect to 17.1, the response provided subsection (d) provides inadequate
information with respect to the documentation supporting the responses.
For example, stating that supporting documents include " text messages " without
further specification (or identification by an exhibit number or bates range) does
not provide enough information to identify these documents.
Please supplement this response.
B.
Responses to Requests for Production The responses to requests for production are
also deficient and non - compliant.
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.280 (a), any documents or category
of documents produced in response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing,
or sampling shall be identified with the specific request number to which the documents
respond.
Plaintiffs ' responses for which documents will be produced simply state, " Please
see documents attached hereto.
" Plaintiffs also provided a link for which there were 644 items produced.
There is no indication as to which documents or items are responsive to the different
requests.
Sanctions may be assessed for production of documents that are in complete disorder
if the court finds that the producing party is responsible for the disordered state
.
(Kayne v.
Grande Holdings Ltd.
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1470, 1476.
) We reserve the right to raise additional objections once the documents are properly
tied to the requests to which they are responsive.
C.
Conclusion Please provide amended, code compliant responses to the Form Interrogatories
and Requests for Production on or before close of business on July 10, 2025.
Should you need additional time to confer with your clients and supplement the deficient
responses as outlined above, we are happy to grant an extension contingent upon a
reciprocal extension of time for the Defendants to bring any motions to compel further
responses.
If we do not receive responses, we will seek appropriate court intervention, including
amending our pending motions to compel and requests for sanctions.
Thank
