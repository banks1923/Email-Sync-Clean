OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE

1 2 from Plaintiff JENNNIFER BURBANK (“ Propounding Party as follows: PRELIMINARY
STATEMENT 3 Responding Party has not completed its investigation of the facts relating
to this case, its 4 discovery or its preparation for trial.
All responses and objections contained herein are based only 5 upon information that
is presently available to and specifically known by Responding Party.
It is 6 || anticipated that further discovery, independent investigation, legal
research and analysis will 7 supply additional facts and add meaning to known facts
, as well as establish entirely new factual 8 conclusions and legal contentions,
all of which may lead to substantial additions to, changes in and 9 variations from
the responses set forth herein.
10 These responses, while based on diligent inquiry and investigation by Responding
Party, 11 reflect only the current state of Responding Party's knowledge, understanding
, and belief, based 12 upon the information reasonably available to it at this time
.
As this action proceeds, and further 13 investigation and discovery are conducted
, additional or different facts and information could be 14 revealed to Responding
Party.
Moreover, Responding Party anticipates that Propounding Party 15 may make legal or
factual contentions presently unknown to and unforeseen by Responding Party 16 which
may require Responding Party to adduce further facts in rebuttal to such contentions
.
17 Consequently, Responding Party may not yet have knowledge and may not fully understand
the 18 significance of information potentially pertinent to these responses.
Accordingly, these responses are provided without prejudice to Responding Party's
right to rely upon and use any information 20 that it subsequently discovers, or
that was omitted from these responses as a result of mistake, 21 inadvertence, surprise
, or excusable neglect.
Without in any way obligating itself to do so, 19 22 Responding Party reserves the
right to modify, supplement, revise, or amend these responses, and 23 to correct
any inadvertent errors or omissions which may be contained herein, in light of the
24 information that Responding Party may subsequently obtain or discover.
25 Nothing in this response should be construed as an admission by Responding Party
with 26 respect to the admissibility or relevance of any fact or document, or of
the truth or accuracy of any 27 characterization or statement of any kind contained
in Propounding Party's requests.
28 Each of the following responses is made solely for the purpose of this action.
Each 2 DEFENDANT GAIL D.

OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE

1 response is subject to all objections as to relevance, materiality, and admissibility
, and to any and 2 all objections on any ground that would require exclusion of any
response if it were introduced in 3 court.
All objections and grounds are expressly reserved and may be interposed at the time
of 4 trial, hearing, or otherwise.
Furthermore, each of the objections contained herein is incorporated 5 by reference
as though fully set forth in each response.
6 The following objections and responses are made without prejudice to Responding
Party's 7 right to produce at trial, or otherwise, evidence regarding any subsequently
discovered 8 information.
Responding Party accordingly reserves the right to modify and amend any and all 9
responses herein as research is completed and contentions are made.
10 Nothing contained herein is to be construed as a waiver of any attorney - client
privilege, 11 work product doctrine, or any other applicable privilege or doctrine
.
To the extent any request 12 may be construed as calling for disclosure of information
protected from discovery by the 13 attorney - client privilege, the work product
doctrine, or any other privilege or protection, a 14 continuing objection to each
and every such request is hereby interposed.
15 16 17 GENERAL OBJECTIONS TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION Responding Party generally
objects to the Requests for Production as follows: A.
Responding Party objects generally to the Requests for Production to the extent that
18 they seek to elicit information that is neither relevant to the subject matter
of this action, nor 19 reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.
20 B.
Responding Party objects generally to the Requests for Production to the extent that
21 they are unreasonably overbroad in scope, and thus burdensome and oppressive,
in that each such 22 request seeks information pertaining to items and matters that
are not relevant to the subject matter 23 of this action, or, if relevant, so remote
therefrom as to make its disclosure of little or no practical 24 benefit to Propounding
Party, while placing a wholly unwarranted burden and expense on 25 Responding Party
in locating, reviewing and producing the requested information.
26 C.
Responding Party objects generally to the Requests for Production to the extent that
27 they are burdensome and oppressive, in that ascertaining the information necessary
to respond to 28 them, and to produce documents in accordance therewith, would require
the review and 3 DEFENDANT GAIL D.
CALHOUN, AS TRUSTEE OF THE GAIL D.
CALHOUN FAMILY TRUST'S RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JENNIFER BURBANK'S REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION
OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE

1 compilation of information from multiple locations, and voluminous records and
files, thereby 2 involving substantial time of employees of Responding Party and
great expense to Responding 3 Party, whereas the information sought to be obtained
by Propounding Party would be of little use 4 150 or benefit to Propounding Party
.
D.
Responding Party objects generally to the Requests for Production to the extent that
6 they are vague, uncertain, overbroad, and without limitation as to time or specific
subject matter.
7 E.
Responding Party objects generally to the Requests for Production to the extent that
8 they seek information at least some of which is protected by the attorney - client
privilege or the 9 attorney work - product doctrine, or both.
10 F.
Responding Party objects generally to the Requests for Production to the extent that
11 they seek to have Defendant furnish information and identify documents that are
a matter of the 12 || public record, and therefore are equally available to the Propounding
Party as they are to 13 Responding Party.
14 G.
Responding Party objects generally to the Requests for Production to the extent that
15 they seek to have Responding Party furnish information and identify documents that
are 16 proprietary to Responding Party and contain confidential information.
17 18 Without waiver of the foregoing, Responding Party further responds as follows
