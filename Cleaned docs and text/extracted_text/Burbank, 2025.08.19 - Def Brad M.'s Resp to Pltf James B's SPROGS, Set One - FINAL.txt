Party ") hereby submits these objections and responses to the First Set of Special
Interrogatories propounded by Plaintiff JAMES BURBANK 1 DEFENDANT BRAD MARTINEZ'S
RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JAMES BURBANK'S SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE

1 (" Propounding Party ") as follows: 2 3 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT Responding Party
has not completed its investigation of the facts relating to this case, its 4 discovery
or its preparation for trial.
All responses and objections contained herein are based only 5 upon information that
is presently available to and specifically known by Responding Party.
It is 6 || anticipated that further discovery, independent investigation, legal
research and analysis will 7 supply additional facts and add meaning to known facts
, as well as establish entirely new factual 8 conclusions and legal contentions,
all of which may lead to substantial additions to, changes in and 9 variations from
the responses set forth herein.
10 These responses, while based on diligent inquiry and investigation by Responding
Party, 11 reflect only the current state of Responding Party's knowledge, understanding
, and belief, based 12 upon the information reasonably available to it at this time
.
As this action proceeds, and further 13 investigation and discovery are conducted
, additional or different facts and information could be 14 revealed to Responding
Party.
Moreover, Responding Party anticipates that Propounding Party 15 may make legal or
factual contentions presently unknown to and unforeseen by Responding Party 16 which
may require Responding Party to adduce further facts in rebuttal to such contentions
.
17 Consequently, Responding Party may not yet have knowledge and may not fully understand
the 18 significance of information potentially pertinent to these responses.
Accordingly, these responses are provided without prejudice to Responding Party's
right to rely upon and use any information 20 that it subsequently discovers, or
that was omitted from these responses as a result of mistake, 21 inadvertence, surprise
, or excusable neglect.
Without in any way obligating itself to do so, 19 22 Responding Party reserves the
right to modify, supplement, revise, or amend these responses, and 23 to correct
any inadvertent errors or omissions which may be contained herein, in light of the
24 information that Responding Party may subsequently obtain or discover.
25 Nothing in this response should be construed as an admission by Responding Party
with 26 respect to the admissibility or relevance of any fact or document, or of
the truth or accuracy of any 27 characterization or statement of any kind contained
in Propounding Party's interrogatories.
28 Each of the following responses is made solely for the purpose of this action.
Each 2 DEFENDANT BRAD MARTINEZ'S RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JAMES BURBANK'S SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
, SET ONE

1 response is subject to all objections as to relevance, materiality, and admissibility
, and to any and 2 all objections on any ground that would require exclusion of any
response if it were introduced in 3 court.
All objections and grounds are expressly reserved and may be interposed at the time
of 4 trial, hearing, or otherwise.
Furthermore, each of the objections contained herein is incorporated 5 by reference
as though fully set forth in each response.
6 The following objections and responses are made without prejudice to Responding
Party's 7 right to produce at trial, or otherwise, evidence regarding any subsequently
discovered 8 information.
Responding Party accordingly reserves the right to modify and amend any and all 9
responses herein as research is completed and contentions are made.
10 11 Nothing contained herein is to be construed as a waiver of any attorney - client
privilege, work product doctrine, or any other applicable privilege or doctrine
.
To the extent any 12 interrogatory may be construed as calling for disclosure of information
protected from discovery 13 by the attorney - client privilege, the work product
doctrine, or any other privilege or protection, a 14 continuing objection to each
and every such interrogatory is hereby interposed.
15 16 17 GENERAL OBJECTIONS TO INTERROGATORIES Responding Party generally objects
to the Interrogatories as follows: A.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
seek to 18 elicit information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of this
action, nor reasonably 19 calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence
.
20 B.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
are 21 unreasonably overbroad in scope, and thus burdensome and oppressive, in that
each such 22 interrogatory seeks information pertaining to items and matters that
are not relevant to the subject 23 matter of this action, or, if relevant, so remote
therefrom as to make its disclosure of little or no 24 practical benefit to Propounding
Party, while placing a wholly unwarranted burden and expense on 25 Responding Party
in locating, reviewing and producing the requested information.
26 C.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
are 27 burdensome and oppressive, in that ascertaining the information necessary
to respond to them 28 would require the review and compilation of information from
multiple locations, and voluminous 3 DEFENDANT BRAD MARTINEZ'S RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF
JAMES BURBANK'S SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE

1 records and files, thereby involving substantial time of employees of Responding
Party and great 2 expense to Responding Party, whereas the information sought to
be obtained by Propounding 3 Party would be of little use or benefit to Propounding
Party.
4 D.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
are 5 vague, uncertain, overbroad, and without limitation as to time or specific
subject matter.
6 E.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
seek 7 information at least some of which is protected by the attorney - client privilege
or the attorney 8 work - product doctrine, or both.
9 F.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
seek to 10 have Responding Party furnish information that is a matter of the public
record, and therefore is 11 equally available to the Propounding Party as they are
to Responding Party.
12 G.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
seek to 13 have Responding Party furnish information that is proprietary to Responding
Party and contain 14 confidential information.
15 H.
Responding Party objects to the interrogatories, and to any individual interrogatory
set 16 forth therein, to the extent that they are compound and constitute an impermissible
effort to 17 circumvent the 35 special interrogatory limit set by Section 2030.030
of the California Code of 18 Civil Procedure.
19 I.
Responding Party expressly incorporates each of the foregoing General Objections into
20 each specific response to the interrogatories set forth below as if set forth in
full therein.
An answer to an interrogatory is not intended to be a waiver of any applicable specific
or general 22 objection to such interrogatory.
21 23 24 Without waiver of the foregoing, Responding Party further responds as follows
