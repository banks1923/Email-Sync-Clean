MARTINEZ (“ Responding Party ”) hereby provides its response to 20 JENNIFER BURBANK'S
(" Propounding Party ") Special Interrogatories (Set One) as follows: 21 22 ■■
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT These responses are made only for the purpose of the within
action.
Each response or answer is subject to all objections as to competence, relevance
, materiality, propriety, admissibility PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
, SET ONE 1

--- Page 2 ---
1 2 and any other objections and grounds that would require the exclusion of any statement
herein if any document was asked of, or if any statement contained therein were made
by a witness present 3 and testifying in court, all of which objections and grounds
are reserved and may be interposed at 4 the time of trial.
5 Plaintiff is responding to all Requests to the extent that information has become
known 6 by him.
However, this responding party's discovery, investigation and preparation for trial
of this 7 matter has not been completed as of the date of these responses, and,
therefore, Plaintiff does not 8 purport to state anything more than information presently
known and discovered by him.
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Plaintiff, in responding to these Requests, reserves
the right to continue discovery and investigation in this matter for facts, witnesses
and supporting data that may recall information which, if he had presently within
his knowledge, would be included in these responses.
For example, to the extent that any request calls for the identification of ‘ all
documents, ” it is responded to fully insofar as information is presently available
to Plaintiff, and Plaintiff is not precluded from presenting at trial information
discovered after the date of the response of this request.
This preliminary statement is incorporated into each of the responses set forth below
.
GENERAL OBJECTIONS To avoid repetition in setting forth specific objections to interrogatories
, responding party sets forth and incorporates the following objections to responding
party's each and every response.
A.
RELEVENCY OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory,
in whole or in part, seek the 20 disclosure of information that is neither relevant
to the subject matter of the action nor reasonably 21 calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence.
22 B.
CONFIDENTIALITY / PRIVACY OBJECTION 22 PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
, SET ONE 2

--- Page 3 ---
1 2 Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory seeks the disclosure
of confidential information and constitute an attempt to invade the personal and /
or financial privacy of certain 3 individuals or persons.
4 5 C.
OVERBREADTH AND BURDEN OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
is overbroad, burdensome and 6 oppressive in that they seek the disclosure of information
that has little or no practical benefit to 7 propounding party while placing an unwarranted
burden or expense on the responding party in 8 ascertaining such information.
Further, such interrogatory is so broadly drawn that although it may 9 10 11 12 13
14 15 16 17 include some relevant information within its scope, it includes information
that is irrelevant or immaterial to the instant action.
Such interrogatory seeks information which is cumulative and / or would require the
compilation of extensive and detailed information from numerous potential sources
, many of which is not easily identifiable or available.
A search for all such information will in many instances involve enormous amounts
of time by responding party.
Further, the interrogatory is so overbroad such that it is uncertain what information
is sought.
D.
AMBIGUITY OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is
phrased in language that is vague, ambiguous, and uncertain such that responding
party is unable to ascertain what information is sought and in order to respond to
this interrogatory, responding party would have to speculate as 18 to propounding
party's intended meaning.
19 E.
AVAILABILITY OBJECTION 20 21 Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
is equally accessible to all parties or is more accessible to the propounding party
or which is maintained primarily by persons or 22 entities other than responding party
.
22 PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE 3

--- Page 4 ---
1 2 3 4 F.
IMPROPER FORM OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
is phrased in improper form because the interrogatory is not “ full and complete in
and of itself ";
or because it contains subpart, “ compound, conjunctive or disjunctive ” question
, such that the interrogatory does not comply with 5 the requirements of California
Code of Civil Procedure $ 2030.060 6 G.
LEGAL CONCLUSION OBJECTION 7 8 9 10 11 12 Responding party objects on the basis that
the interrogatory calls for a legal conclusion.
H.
ATTORNEY WORK - PRODUCT OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
, in whole or in part, seeks disclosure of information that is protected under the
attorney work - product doctrine.
I.
MARITAL PRIVILEGE OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the request
, in whole or in part, seek disclosure of information that is protected under marital
privilege.
