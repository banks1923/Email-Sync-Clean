: 61.1 Outside Humidity: 81.2 Outside Conditions: rain Indoor Temperature: 65.1
Indoor Humidity: 66.2 Basic Mold Inspection Details: A basic mold inspection by
an MI & T inspector includes a full visual assessment of a property's readily accessible
areas with use of specific tools of our trade in order to identify any possible "
red flags " that could be causing a mold growth problem.
It also includes the collection of 2 air samples.
The first must be taken from outside and serves as a " control, " every home or business
has " normal " levels of mold and this will determine what is acceptable for a property
in your area.
It also shows that all the equipment / supplies used were working properly and makes
our results legally binding.
The other air sample is taken from the area inside the home or business that the inspector
and client agree is the area of greatest concern.
These 2 air samples will determine whether or not elevated conditions exist at the
property in question.
Advanced Mold Testing: For those that wish to confirm the source of a mold problem
and receive specific instructions for remediation, additional mold testing is necessary
.
We offer surface samples via tape lift / swabs and in - wall cavity air samples to
accomplish this task.
When an inspector finds something specific that they believe is compromising the indoor
air quality of a property, he will suggest one of the above samples mentioned.
If the problem shown by the general air sample is the same seen at the localized testing
location, we can not only confirm that is the source of a problem, but also offer
exactly what you need to do in order to fix it.
If the problem area is large enough, multiple samples may be suggested to establish
precisely what has been contaminated.
Additional general air samples are also beneficial to determine how far an air quality
problem has spread.

| Office@mitmold.com Based on the findings of the visual inspection and lab results
of samples collected during the inspection, it is our professional opinion that the
area be treated as contaminated due to recurring exterior moisture intrusion and current
excess moisture content of building materials.
Elevated Airborne Mold Conditions Exist: NO Excess Moisture Content Present: YES
Recurring Moisture Intrusion: YES Professional Mold Remediation Recommended: YES
CHOOSING A MOLD REMEDIATION COMPANY: It is important to understand there is a difference
between a general remodel and a mold remediation.
Later in this document we will lay out recommended remediation steps.
This protocol should be carried out by a restoration company / technician with both
education and experience dealing with mold.
While some general contractors are prepared to complete a mold remediation properly
, the majority are not equipped to carry out all the recommend steps unless restoration
is a focus of the business.
Failure to complete all of the steps may result in lingering indoor air quality problems
or even worse, the mold problem returning entirely.
Many of our clients turn to us for a recommendation on what company to use for the
mold removal.
In an effort to stay separate from the restoration process and help our clients with
this process, we have compiled a list of reputable companies in your area.
MI & T is not affiliated with these companies.
If you have a negative experience with one of them please inform us and we will re
- evaluate their placement.
Requirements to be listed: IICRC Certified, Properly Licensed, Insured, No Unclosed
BBB Complaints, Positive Online Reputation.

General Observations Observation Musty Smell or Odor Water Damage Excess Humidity
Excess Moisture Visual Growth Roof Leak HVAC Problem Exterior Moisture Intrusion Issue
Health Complications Localized Problem Widespread Problem Control Sample Taken Yes
No ✓ ✓ Additional Notes: Client stated multiple previous water intrusion incidents
.
Multiple rooms have an audible " squish " when stepping upon flooring, with some
areas squeezing out water.
Suspect growth beneath Closet flooring, with moisture staining present on flooring
as well as the concrete slab.
No active plumbing leaks were found at the time of inspection.
Signs point to recurring exterior water intrusion (Category 2 water from the time
of initial moistue intrusion) due to inadequate exterior drainage.
While the air sample collected shows normal airborne fungal ecology at the time of
inspection, the conditions necessary for mold growth to proliferate are all present
.
Air samples are not an indication of either past nor future exposure, they are a
measurement relating to the time of inspection only.
Given the recurring nature of the exterior moisture intrusion, and the affected Closet
being far from the intrusion point, it stands to reason that the rooms between the
Front Door / Patio and the Closet (and possibly extending beyond the Closet) would
also be impacted.
As exterior walls (which contain insulation) would be impacted, IICRC standard
for water mitigation states that, at minimum, a flood cut should be performed on
walls / framing impacted by water damage.
Insulation not only will wick / absorb moisture and retain water, but also will lose
their R - value for insulative properties once moisture damage occurs.
It was stated ■ MitMold

by the client that no attempts at professional dry - out occurred.
With these things in mind, it is recommended to treat the areas affected by previous
and current moisture intrusion as contaminated, and to be treated as a remediation
project under containment and negative pressure.
Remediation recommendations further into this report.

Mold Remediation Recommendations MIT Mold Inspection & Testing | MI & T Nationwide
Unbiased Mold Testing Website: http://mitmold.com 855-600-6653 | Office@mitmold.com
If your advanced mold testing report came back showing elevated levels of mold, it
should have a supplementary test (s) confirming the source of a problem.
This report should have detailed findings for each additional sample taken.
When a test indicates a problem, we identify which remediation steps must be performed
at that area.
Below you will find a more detailed explanation of each of those steps.
If professional mold remediation is recommended, this work should be carried out
by a mold removal professional that is trained and has the equipment necessary to
complete each task as instructed.
Please do not attempt to handle this work on your own.
Doing so puts your health and the health of other occupants of the property at risk
.
Professional Mold Remediation Recommended: YES Source of Mold Growth: Recurring
Exterior Moisture Intrusion REMEDIATION STEPS Vacate Premises - During Work (Problem

Protective Equipment Negative Pressure Used HEPA Vacuum Apply Biocide / Wipe - down
Removing Contaminated Material Salvaged / Restored (If applicable to item tested
) Final Cleaning Air Scrubber HVAC System Cleaning Post Remediation Inspection Containment
During Reconstruction ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Description of Work Area If Necessary: Based on mold
test results and inspection, it is recommended to treat the area as contaminated
due to recurring moisture intrusion (Category 2 water as originating from an exterior
source) and the likelihood of excess moisture content and mold growth within the
wall cavities.
A professional restoration company should be contracted to perform the necessary remediation
.
The following work should be carried out: An active moisture intrusion / leak exists
in the area.
Consult with the appropriate licensed contractor to repair the source of the moisture
prior to remediation, or in conjunction with the remediation, as applicable.
As work will be taking place throughout, containment is not necessary.
Due to the entry area being part of X MitMold

the remediation, access to the home will be impeded by the work taking place.
As such, it is recommended to vacate the premises during any work being performed
.
Set up air scrubbers of appropriate CFM for the volume of the work area, to be exhausted
outside of the building, using negative pressure.
As actively wet structural materials exist, a dehumidifier should be used during
remediation.
Air movers are NOT to be installed and used until all affected non - structural building
materials have been removed, and the area has been appropriately cleaned.
All structural building material needs to be returned to a normal moisture content
.
All porous and non - porous personal contents without moisture damage or visible growth
within the work area should be removed from the work area.
All fibrous contents and non - porous personal contents with moisture damage or visible
growth should be evaluated by a restoration / remediation contractor to either be
cleaned and removed from the work area, or discarded.
Remove all affected non - structural material (baseboard, door trim, drywall,
insulation, tack strip, carpet, pad, vinyl flooring, laminate flooring, etc.
as applicable) to a minimum of 12 " beyond any visible growth or moisture damage
found, including within the wall cavity and beneath non - structural flooring.
Continue non - structural material removal until all instances of visible growth and
moisture damage have been removed, and all instances of visible growth and moisture
damage on structural material have been exposed.
All insulation exposed during affected material removal should be removed and discarded
, not to be replaced until after clearance testing.
All structural material exposed by removing affected non- structural material should
remain open and accessible until after clearance testing.
** Note: Non - porous flooring that was impacted can be cleaned, set aside, and
reused once rebuild occurs.
Tile on slab does NOT have to be removed unless an underlayment is present.
All porous materials that were impacted should be discarded.
** ** If damage extends to Kitchen ** Any affected cabinetry should be removed and
discarded.
Remove all affected non - structural material (baseboard, door trim, drywall,
insulation, tack strip, carpet, pad, vinyl flooring, laminate flooring, etc.
as applicable) to a minimum of 12 " beyond any visible growth or moisture damage
found, including within the wall cavity and beneath non - structural flooring.
Continue non - structural material removal until all instances of visible growth and
moisture damage have been removed, and all instances of visible growth and moisture
damage on structural material have been exposed.
All insulation exposed during affected material removal should be removed and discarded
, not to be replaced until after clearance testing.
All structural material exposed by removing affected non structural material should
remain open and accessible until after clearance testing.
** If damaged extends to Bathroom ** -Affected vanity should be removed and discarded
, if applicable.
-Remove toilet for access to affected flooring and drywall, if applicable.
-Tile and drywall / backerboard surrounding tub / shower should be removed and discarded
, if applicable.
-Tub / shower pan should be removed, if applicable.
Remove all affected non - structural material (baseboard, door trim, drywall,
insulation, tack strip, carpet, pad, vinyl flooring, laminate flooring, etc.
as applicable) to a minimum of 12 " beyond any visible growth or moisture damage
found, including within the wall cavity and beneath non - structural flooring.
Continue non - structural material removal until all instances of visible growth and
moisture damage have been removed, and all instances of visible growth and moisture
damage on structural material have been exposed.
All insulation exposed during affected material removal should be removed and discarded
, not to be replaced until after clearance testing.
All structural material exposed by removing affected non- ■ MitMold

structural material should remain open and accessible until after clearance testing
.
Clean and treat all surfaces within the work area.
All vertical and horizontal surfaces are to be cleaned by HEPA vacuuming, and wiping
with an anti - microbial.
Run air scrubbers on negative pressure throughout material removal and cleaning.
Switch air scrubbers to scrub - only for 48 hours after completion of final cleaning
.
Shut off air scrubbers 24 hours prior to clearance testing.
All exposed structural material is to remain accessible for verification of dry and
clean conditions.
MI & T recommends clearance testing before rebuild process begins to ensure work has
been completed properly.
Due to the fact that our observations are made during limited time on site, we are
unable to determine the exact cause of the humidity issue, but seems likely that
it is related to the recurring exterior moisture intrusion and retention of water
in building materials.
Some additional suggestions that should be followed to ensure the mold problems do
not return: -Keep humidity at or below 50 % throughout.
-An Air Conditioner's purpose is to not only cool a building but also to serve as
a dehumidifier.
It should be used even when unoccupied.
-Avoid having large items placed directly on exterior walls as these walls need to
breathe in order to cool off and avoid condensation and mold growth.
-If you close vents in unused rooms, be sure to monitor humidity levels.
-Utilize Exhaust fans and leave doors open to rooms prone to humidity like closets
, bathrooms, and laundry rooms.
-Consider installing a dehumidifier in any troubling area;
basements, additions, poorly insulated, etc.
may Since air samples indicate problem is not yet airborne, an air duct cleaning
is not necessary but it want to consider it as an extra precaution and recommended
to improve air quality even if a mold problem does not exist.
It is imperative that any source of water intrusion be addressed to ensure mold growth
does not return.

(MIT) # 1: Vacating the Premises Mold Inspection & Testing | MI & T Nationwide
Unbiased Mold Testing Website: http://mitmold.com 855-600-6653 | Office@mitmold.com
 Vacating people from the adjacent spaces is usually only necessary for a large /
widespread problem but is also recommended for individuals with reduced immune systems
, elderly, infants, recent surgery patients, people with chronic inflammatory lung
disease or individuals with respiratory health concerns.
# 2: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)  Full - face respirators are to be worn
.
 Gloves are to be worn to remove all infected building materials.
 Disposable Tyvek coveralls covering both the head and shoes shall be worn.
# 3: Containment of Each of the Contaminated Area  Complete isolation of the work
area using plastic (6 mil poly) sheeting sealed with tape.
 If a containment area blocks the only entrance, vacating the property is usually
recommended during remediation.
 If the problem is widespread and the entire property needs remediation, no containment
is necessary.
 This area should be large enough to house any contaminated materials Sealing with
plastic sheeting (6 mil poly) all ventilation, ducts / grills, fixtures and other
openings.
# 4: Negative Pressure Used  Use an exhaust fan with a HEPA filter to generate negative
pressurization (ventilating to the outdoors).
Use the appropriate sized unit for the space.
The air exchange rate must be six times per hour.
# 5: HEPA Vacuum  Any area that is in the same area of contaminated materials should
be HEPA vacuumed, starting at highest point and working down to the floor.
Any area that is contained should be completely HEPA - Vaced.
 This should be done before AND after removing contaminated materials.
 If the entire property is contaminated, the entire property needs to be HEPA -
Vaced.
# 6: Applying Biocide Apply biocide to visible fungal growth prior to removal of
material.
Wait thirty minutes before removing the material.
This provides sufficient time for the biocide to disinfect the material and reduces
the dust generated because the material is wetted.
 This should be done before AND after removing contaminated materials # 7: Removal
and Discarding of Contaminated Materials  Remove infected drywall, insulation and
building material least twelve inches past any visual mold.
 All debris should be double bagged in 3 mil contractor bags twisted, goose necked
and sealed with duct tape.
 The sealed bags are to be wiped clean with the appropriate disinfectant in the containment
before transport to the disposal area.
MitMold

 There are no special requirements for the disposal of moldy material.
Moldy materials that are bagged can be disposed of with other general waste.
 All contaminated materials should be wrapped in plastic and sealed with tape before
being taken out of the containment area through the unaffected areas for disposal
.
 Sometimes building material, furniture, flooring, etc can not be evaluated until
it has been jarred from its location.
For cases like this, the mold remediation company hired should be trusted to give
an honest evaluation.
# 8: Restoring a Damaged Item  If an item such as kitchen cabinets, clothing,
furniture, etc were damaged you should have a yes / no answer to whether or not your
item can be restored  How this needs to be done is dependent upon the item in question
.
Wood may require sanding, clothes a simple rinse in the wash, etc.
 Some items like cabinets may appear to be salvaged, but after they are removed
the damage is worse than our inspector anticipated.
Trust the mold professional you hire for advice on whether or not something can be
restored.
# 9: Final Cleaning  After the contaminated material has been removed, the contained
area is to be HEPA vacuumed again.
 If any visual mold is seen on studs HEPA sand affected area.
 In the event that an item cannot be restored it must be replaced, even if it is
building material.
 The contained area is to be wiped down with a biocide and / or detergent solution
.
 The contained area is to be HEPA vacuumed again.
# 10: Air Scrubber (s)  Multiple air scrubbers should be used for properties with
a widespread problem and no containment area.
How many should be a decision trusted in the hands of the mold remediation company
hired.
 An Air Scrubber should be placed in each containment area for 48-72 hours.
# 11 Air Duct Cleaning  Every mold remediation should be completed with a thorough
cleaning of the HVAC system and air ducts.
 Sanitize / Disinfect air handler coils.
 Sanitize / Disinfect all duct work # 12: Final Inspections  Prior to containment
removal and re - occupancy of the space a certified mold inspector should do a visual
inspection and air sampling.
Air sample should be taken both within the containment and in an adjacent area to
insure spores have not spread to other areas.
 After passing post remediation testing you may choose to apply a sealant around
studs.
 Containment removal and re - occupancy shall occur when space passes appropriate
verification testing.
# 13: Containment Used During Reconstruction  After the work area has passed clearance
testing, the enclosure can be used to contain the dusts generated by sheetrock sanding
and taping activities.
This is done to reduce the clean up when reconstruction is complete.
