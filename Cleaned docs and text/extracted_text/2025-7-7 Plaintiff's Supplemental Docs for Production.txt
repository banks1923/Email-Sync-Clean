As an alternative, we propose the option to withdraw the non - renewal notice and
have you remain in the residence on a month - to - month basis.
Section 2A / 2B of the lease agreement outlines this option.
Please let us know what you decide.

a vacate date of September 15, 2024, and included specific terms.
In contrast, the notice sent on August 23, 2024, lists a different vacate date
of September 8, 2024, along with additional updated terms.
Given that these notices contain different vacate dates and terms, they are entirely
separate and different notices.
The notice provided on August 23, 2024, cannot reasonably be considered a â€œ reminder
" of the original notice, as it alters both the vacate date and the terms.
Unless you are indicating that you have decided to change the original notice's vacate
date and terms and are now attempting to pass the August 23, 2024, notice as a continuation
of the original notice from June 19, 2024.
Can you please confirm which notice is in effect?
Is it the first notice sent on June 19, 2024 or the second

the original lease.
In the first communication sent on June 19, 2024 you were provided a greater than
60 - day notice that the lease would not be renewed.
The communication sent August 23, 2024 was only provided as a reminder and in no
way supersedes the original notification.
As stated in the August 23,2024 email, we are more than willing to consider your
request for more time, however that needs to be communicated clearly so that an agreement
can be reached.
You are welcome to stay until September 15,2024 if that is your preference.
Would that be your preference?

Approval should be based on the documentation I've already provided.
I'd also appreciate an update on the status of the non - renewal notice from June

Since my emotional support animal has been disclosed and a formal request made, the
no - animal policy no longer applies as a reason for non - renewal.
Additionally, the alteration was acknowledged on May 22, 2024, with no further

request.
Due to the lease ending on September 8, 2024, we are not requiring you to comply
with the process for requesting reasonable accommodation of an emotional support animal

a licensed healthcare professional explaining the need.
