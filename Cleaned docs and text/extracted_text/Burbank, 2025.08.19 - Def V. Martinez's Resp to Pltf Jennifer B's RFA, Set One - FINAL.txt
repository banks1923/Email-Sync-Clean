TO PLAINTIFF JENNIFER BURBANK'S REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS, SET ONE

--- Page 2 ---
1 responses to the First Set of Request for Admissions propounded by Plaintiff JENNIFER
2 || BURBANK (“ Propounding Party ") as follows: 3 4 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT Responding
Party has not completed its investigation of the facts relating to this case, its
5 discovery or its preparation for trial.
All responses and objections contained herein are based only 6 || upon information
that is presently available to and specifically known by Responding Party.
It is 7 || anticipated that further discovery, independent investigation, legal
research and analysis will 8 supply additional facts and add meaning to known facts
, as well as establish entirely new factual 9 conclusions and legal contentions,
all of which may lead to substantial additions to, changes in and 10 variations from
the responses set forth herein.
11 These responses, while based on diligent inquiry and investigation by Responding
Party, 12 reflect only the current state of Responding Party's knowledge, understanding
, and belief, based 13 upon the information reasonably available to it at this time
.
As this action proceeds, and further 14 || investigation and discovery are conducted
, additional or different facts and information could be 15 revealed to Responding
Party.
Moreover, Responding Party anticipates that Propounding Party 16 may make legal or
factual contentions presently unknown to and unforeseen by Responding Party 17 which
may require Responding Party to adduce further facts in rebuttal to such contentions
.
18 Consequently, Responding Party may not yet have knowledge and may not fully understand
the 19 significance of information potentially pertinent to these responses.
Accordingly, these responses 20 are provided without prejudice to Responding Party's
right to rely upon and use any information 21 that it subsequently discovers, or
that was omitted from these responses as a result of mistake, 22 inadvertence, surprise
, or excusable neglect.
Without in any way obligating itself to do so, 23 Responding Party reserves the right
to modify, supplement, revise, or amend these responses, and 24 to correct any
inadvertent errors or omissions which may be contained herein, in light of the 25
information that Responding Party may subsequently obtain or discover.
26 Nothing in this response should be construed as an admission by Responding Party
with 27 respect to the admissibility or relevance of any fact or document, or of
the truth or accuracy of any 28 characterization or statement of any kind contained
in Propounding Party's requests.

ADMISSIONS, SET ONE

--- Page 3 ---
1 Each of the following responses is made solely for the purpose of this action.
Each 2 response is subject to all objections as to relevance, materiality, and admissibility
, and to any and 3 all objections on any ground that would require exclusion of any
response if it were introduced in 4 court.
All objections and grounds are expressly reserved and may be interposed at the time
of 5 trial, hearing, or otherwise.
Furthermore, each of the objections contained herein is incorporated 6 by reference
as though fully set forth in each response.
7 The following objections and responses are made without prejudice to Responding
Party's 8 right to produce at trial, or otherwise, evidence regarding any subsequently
discovered 9 information.
Responding Party accordingly reserves the right to modify and amend any and all 10
responses herein as research is completed and contentions are made.
11 Nothing contained herein is to be construed as a waiver of any attorney - client
privilege, 12 work product doctrine, or any other applicable privilege or doctrine
.
To the extent any request 13 may be construed as calling for disclosure of information
protected from discovery by the 14 attorney - client privilege, the work product
doctrine, or any other privilege or protection, a 15 continuing objection to each
and every such request is hereby interposed.
16 17 18 GENERAL OBJECTIONS TO REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS Responding Party generally objects
to the Request for Admissions as follows: A.
Responding Party objects generally to the Request for Admissions to the extent that
19 they seek to elicit information that is neither relevant to the subject matter
of this action, nor 20 reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.
21 B.
Responding Party objects generally to the Request for Admissions to the extent that
22 they are unreasonably overbroad in scope, and thus burdensome and oppressive,
in that each such 23 request seeks information pertaining to items and matters that
are not relevant to the subject matter 24 of this action, or, if relevant, so remote
therefrom as to make its disclosure of little or no practical 25 benefit to Propounding
Party, while placing a wholly unwarranted burden and expense on 26 Responding Party
in locating, reviewing and producing the requested information.
27 C.
Responding Party objects generally to the Request for Admissions to the extent that
28 they are burdensome and oppressive, in that ascertaining the information necessary
to respond to 3 DEFENDANT VICKI MARTINEZ'S RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JENNIFER BURBANK'S
REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS, SET ONE

--- Page 4 ---
1 them would require the review and compilation of information from multiple locations
, and 2 voluminous records and files, thereby involving substantial time of employees
of Responding 3 Party and great expense to Responding Party, whereas the information
sought to be obtained by 4 Propounding Party would be of little use or benefit to
Propounding Party.
150 D.
Responding Party objects generally to the Request for Admissions to the extent that
6 they are vague, uncertain, overbroad and without limitation as to time or specific
subject matter.
7 E.
Responding Party objects generally to the Requests for Admission to the extent that
8 they seek information at least some of which is protected by the attorney - client
privilege or the 9 attorney work - product doctrine, or both.
10 F.
Responding Party objects generally to the Request for Admissions to the extent that
11 they seek to have Responding Party furnish information that is a matter of the
public record, and 12 therefore is equally available to the Propounding Party as
they are to Responding Party.
13 G.
Responding Party objects generally to the Request for Admissions to the extent that
14 they seek to have Responding Party furnish information that is proprietary to Responding
Party 15 and contain confidential information.
16 H.
Responding Party objects to the Request for Admissions, and to any individual request
17 set forth therein, to the extent that they are compound and constitute an impermissible
effort to 18 circumvent the 35 special request limit set by Section 2033.030 of the
California Code of Civil 19 Procedure.
20 I.
Responding Party expressly incorporates each of the foregoing General Objections into
21 each specific response to the requests set forth below as if set forth in full
therein.
An answer to a 22 request is not intended to be a waiver of any applicable specific
or general objection to such 23 request.
Without waiver of the foregoing, Responding Party further responds as follows: RESPONSES
