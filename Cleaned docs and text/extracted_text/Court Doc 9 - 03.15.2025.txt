INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING UNLIMITED CIVIL CASES The following critical provisions
of the California Rules of Court, Title 3, Division 7, as applicable in the Superior
Court, are summarized your assistance.
for APPLICATION The Division 7 Rules were effective January 1, 2007.
They apply to all general civil cases.
PRIORITY OVER OTHER RULES The Division 7 Rules shall have priority over all other
Local Rules to the extent the others are inconsistent.
CHALLENGE TO ASSIGNED JUDGE A challenge under Code of Civil Procedure Section 170.6
must be made within 15 days after notice of assignment for all to a judge, or if
a party has not yet appeared, within 15 days of the first appearance.
TIME STANDARDS Cases assigned to the Independent Calendaring Courts will be subject
to processing under the following time standards: COMPLAINTS All complaints shall
be served within 60 days of filing and proof of service shall be filed within 90 days
.
CROSS - COMPLAINTS purposes Without leave of court first being obtained, no cross
- complaint may be filed by any party after their answer is filed.
Cross- complaints shall be served within 30 days of the filing date and a proof of
service filed within 60 days of the filing date.
STATUS CONFERENCE A status conference will be scheduled by the assigned Independent
Calendar Judge no later than 270 days after the filing of the complaint.
Counsel must be fully prepared to discuss the following issues: alternative dispute
resolution, bifurcation, settlement, trial date, and expert witnesses.
FINAL STATUS CONFERENCE The Court will require the parties to attend a final status
conference not more than 10 days before the scheduled trial date.
All parties shall have motions in limine, bifurcation motions, statements of major
evidentiary issues, dispositive motions, requested form jury instructions, special
jury instructions, and special jury verdicts timely filed and served prior to the
conference.
These matters may be heard and resolved at this conference.
At least five days before this conference, counsel must also have exchanged lists
of exhibits and witnesses, and have submitted to the court a brief statement of the
case to be read to the jury panel as required by Chapter Three of the Los Angeles
Superior Court Rules.
SANCTIONS The court will impose appropriate sanctions for the failure or refusal to
comply with Chapter Three Rules, orders made by the Court, and time standards or
deadlines established by the Court or by the Chapter Three Rules.
Such sanctions may be on a party, or if appropriate, on counsel for a party.
This is not a complete delineation of the Division 7 or Chapter Three Rules, and
adherence only to the above provisions is therefore not a guarantee against the imposition
of sanctions under Trial Court Delay Reduction.
Careful reading and compliance with the actual Chapter Rules is imperative.
Class Actions Pursuant to Local Rule 2.3, all class actions shall be filed at the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse and are randomly assigned to a complex judge at the designated
complex courthouse.
If the case is found not to be a class action it will be returned to an Independent
Calendar Courtroom for all purposes.
* Provisionally Complex Cases Cases filed as provisionally complex are initially assigned
to the Supervising Judge of complex litigation for determination of complex status
.
If the case is deemed to be complex within the meaning of California Rules of Court
3.400 et seq.
, it will be randomly assigned to a complex judge at the designated complex courthouse
.
If the case is found not to be complex, it will be returned to an Independent Calendar
Courtroom for all purposes.
