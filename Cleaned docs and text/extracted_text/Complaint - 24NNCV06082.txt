OF REALTORS * DISCLOSURE REGARDING REAL ESTATE AGENCY RELATIONSHIP (As required by
the Civil Code) (C.A.R.
Form AD, Revised 12/21) G COLDWELL BANKER REALTY ■ (If checked) This form is being
provided in connection with a transaction for a leasehold interest exceeding one year
as per Civil Code section 2079.13 (j).
(k), and (I).
When you enter into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate
transaction, you should from the outset understand what type of agency relationship
or representation you wish to have with the agent in the transaction.
SELLER'S AGENT A Seller's agent under a listing agreement with the Seller acts as
the agent for the Seller only.
A Seller's agent or a subagent of that agent has the following affirmative obligations
: To the Seller: A Fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty
in dealings with the Seller.
To the Buyer and the Seller: (a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care
in performance of the agent's duties.
(b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith.
(c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value
or desirability of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention
and observation of, the parties.
An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidentia!
information obtained from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties
set forth above.
BUYER'S AGENT A Buyer's agent can, with a Buyer's consent, agree to act as agent
for the Buyer only.
In these situations, the agent is not the Seller's agent, even if by agreement the
agent may receive compensation for services rendered, either in full or in part from
the Seller.
An agent acting only for a Buyer has the following affirmative obligations: To the
Buyer: A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings
with the Buyer.
To the Buyer and the Seller: (a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care
in performance of the agent's duties.
(b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith.
(c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value
or desirability of the property that are not known to.
or within the diligent attention and observation of, the parties.
An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential information obtained
from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above
.
AGENT REPRESENTING BOTH SELLER AND BUYER A real estate agent, either acting directly
or through one or more salespersons and broker associates, can legally be the agent
of both the Seller and the Buyer in a transaction, but only with the knowledge and
consent of both the Seller and the Buyer.
In a dual agency situation, the agent has the following affirmative obligations to
both the Seller and the Buyer: (a) A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity
, honesty and loyalty in the dealings with either the Seller or the Buyer.
(b) Other duties to the Seller and the Buyer as stated above in their respective
sections.
In representing both Seller and Buyer, a dual agent may not, without the express
permission of the respective party, disclose to the other party confidential information
, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either the Buyer's or Seller's
financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information
that may impact price, including the Seller's willingness to accept a price less
than the listing price or the Buyer's willingness to pay a price greater than the
price offered.
SELLER AND BUYER RESPONSIBILITIES Either the purchase agreement or a separate document
will contain a confirmation of which agent is representing you and whether that agent
is representing you exclusively in the transaction or acting as a dual agent.
Please pay attention to that confirmation to make sure it accurately reflects your
understanding of your agent's role.
The above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Seller
or Buyer from the responsibility to protect his or her own interests.
You should carefully read all agreements to assure that they adequately express your
understanding of the transaction.
A real estate agent is a person qualified to advise about real estate.
If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent professional.
if you are a Buyer, you have the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect yourself
, including as to those facts about the property which are known to you or within
your diligent attention and observation.
Both Sellers and Buyers should strongly consider obtaining lax advice from a competent
professional because the federal and state tax consequences of a transaction can be
complex and subject to change.
Throughout your real property transaction you may receive more than one disclosure
form, depending upon the number of agents assisting in the transaction.
The law requires each agent with whom you have more than a casual relationship to
present you with this disclosure form.
You should read its contents each time it is presented to you, considering the relationship
between you and the real estate agent in your specific transaction.
This disclosure form includes the provisions of Sections 2079.13 to 2079.24, inclusive
, of the Civil Code set forth on page 2.
Read it carefully.

REALTY (" Property ").
Property Address: 518 N Stoneman Ave.
, Alhambra, California 91801 WIRE FRAUD AND ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS ADVISORY:
The ability to communicate and conduct business electronically is a convenience and
reality in nearly all parts of our lives.
At the same time, it has provided hackers and scammers new opportunities for their
criminal activity.
Many businesses have been victimized and the real estate business is no exception
.
While wiring or electronically transferring funds is a welcome convenience, we all
need to exercise extreme caution.
Emails attempting to induce fraudulent wire transfers have been received and have
appeared to be legitimate.
Reports indicate that some hackers have been able to intercept emailed transfer instructions
, obtain account information and, by altering some of the data, redirect the funds
to a different account.
It also appears that some hackers were able to provide false phone numbers for verifying
the wiring or funds transfer instructions.
In those cases, the victim called the number provided to confirm the instructions
, and then unwittingly authorized a transfer to somewhere or someone other than the
intended recipient.
ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE ADVISED: 1.
Obtain phone numbers and account numbers only from Escrow Officers, Property Managers
, or Landlords at the beginning of the transaction.
2.
DO NOT EVER WIRE OR ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFER FUNDS PRIOR TO CALLING TO CONFIRM THE
TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS.
ONLY USE A PHONE NUMBER YOU WERE PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY.
Do not use any different phone number or account number included in any emailed transfer
instructions.
3.
Oraily confirm the transfer instruction is legitimate and confirm the bank routing
number, account numbers and other codes before taking steps to transfer the funds
.
4.
Avoid sending personal information in emails or texts.
Provide such information in person or over the telephone directly to the Escrow Officer
, Property Manager, or Landlord.
5.
Take steps to secure the system you are using with your email account.
These steps include creating strong passwords, using secure WiFi, and not using
free services.
If you believe you have received questionable or suspicious wire or funds transfer
instructions, immediately notify your bank, and the other party, and the Escrow
Office, Landlord, or Property Manager.

Pre - engineered strapping kits for such devices are not readily available;
and Bolting already exists that would help avoid displacement or breakage in the event
of an earthquake.
2.
LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: Some local ordinances impose more stringent water heater bracing
.
anchoring or strapping requirements than does California Law.
Therefore, it is important to check with local city or county building and safety
departments regarding the applicable water heater bracing, anchoring or strapping
requirements for your property.
3.
TRANSFEROR'S WRITTEN STATEMENT: California Health and Safety Code §19211 requires
the seller of any real property containing a water heater to certify, in writing

Statement with the Department of Housing and Community Development.
4.

4.
INSTALLATION OF CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS: A.
Requirements: California law (Health and Safety Code $$ 13260 to 13263 and 17296
to 17206.2) requires that as of July 1, 2011, all existing single - family dwellings
have carbon monoxide detectors installed and that all other types of dwelling units
intended for human occupancy have carbon monoxide detectors installed on or before
January 1, 2013.
The January 1, 2013 requirement applies to a duplex, lodging house, dormitory,
hotel, condominium, time - share and apartment, among others.
B.
Exceptions: The law does not apply to a dwelling unit which does not have any of
the following: a fossil fuel burning heater or appliance, a fireplace, or an attached
garage.
The law does not apply to dwelling units owned or leased by the State of California
, the Regents of the University of California or focal government agencies.
Aside from these three owner types, there are no other owner exemptions from the
installation requirement;
it applies to all owners of dwellings, be they individual banks, corporations,
or other entities.
There is no exemption for REO properties.
DISCLOSURE OF CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS: The Health and Safety Code does not require
a disclosure regarding the existence of carbon monoxide detectors in a dwelling.
However, a seller of residential 1-4 property who is required to complete a Real
Estate Transfer Disclosure Statement, (C.A.R.
Form TDS) or a Manufactured Home and Mobile home Transfer Disclosure Statement (
C.A.R.
Form MHTDS) must use section II A of that form to disclose if the dwelling unit has
a carbon monoxide detector.
COMPLIANCE WITH INSTALLATION REQUIREMENT: State building code requires at a minimum
, placement of carbon monoxide detectors in applicable properties outside of each
sleeping area, and on each floor in a multi - level dwelling but additional or different
requirements may apply depending on local building standards and manufacturer instructions
.
An owner who fails to install a carbon monoxide detector when required by law and
continues to fail to install the detector after being given notice by a governmental
agency could be liable for a fine of up to $ 200 for each violation.
A transfer of a property where a seller, as an owner, has not installed carbon monoxide
detectors, when required to do so by law, will not be invalidated, but the seller
/ owner could be subject to damages of up to $ 100, plus court costs and attorney
fees.
Buyer and Seller are each advised to consult with their own home inspector, contractor
or building department to determine the exact location for installation of carbon
monoxide detectors.
Buyer is advised to consult with a professional of Buyer's choosing to determine whether
the property has carbon monoxide detector (s) installed as required by law, and
if not to discuss with their counsel the potential consequences.
LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: Some localities maintain their own retrofit or point of sale
requirements which may include the requirement that a carbon monoxide detector be
installed prior to a transfer of property.
Therefore, it is important to check the local city or county building and safety
departments regarding point of sale or retrofit requirements when transferring property
.

their sleep and do not realize they were bitten.

to person.

a person was bitten, if at all.

DocuSign Envelope ID: BEBBB34E - 2815-40EE - A88B - 704908D522A5 Information on Dampness
and Mold for Renters in California Main points:  Living in damp or moldy buildings
increases the chances of respiratory problems like asthma.
* The critical warning signs are visible mold, water damage, damp materials, or
mold smell.
* Dampness is needed for mold to grow, so if you control the dampness, you control
the mold.
 Dampness or mold indoors may make housing substandard, per the California Health
& Safety Code.
This booklet describes the increased risks to health, including specific health issues
, that may result from exposures to dampness or mold in buildings.
This booklet was produced in January 2021 by the California Department of Public Health
(CDPH) in accordance with the 2001 Toxic Mold Protection Act (HSC $ 26148).

DocuSign Envelope ID: BEBBB34E - 2815-40EE - A888-704908D522A5 Health Problems from
Damp or Moldy Buildings Living or working in damp or moldy buildings increases the
risk of many harmful health problems, including:  asthma attacks in people who
already have asthma a new asthma diagnosis  respiratory infections, such as bronchitis
 breathing symptoms, such as hay fever, sneezing, stuffy nose, sore throat,
wheezing, breathing difficulty, or cough eczema or skin rash Mold can affect people
differently.
How much a person is affected depends on how sensitive they are and on how much they
are exposed.
Damp or moldy buildings are linked to health problems in people even if they do not
have allergies.
Signs of Dampness or Mold Signs of dampness or mold that may cause health problems
include: ■ visible mold (regardless of color), such as on walls or ceilings,
behind furniture or appliances, under carpets, or even hidden in areas not seen
in the occupied areas of homes ■ mold odor, noticed as an earthy, musty, or moldy
smell ■ visible water damage, such as water - stains or discoloration on walls or
ceilings, peeling or bubbled paint, warped floors, or rotting wood ■ damp or moist
materials, including condensation on windows or walls Any one of these signs indicates
increased risks to health, and the more that any of them are present, the greater
the risk of health problems.
Tests that identify the types of mold or the amounts of mold in buildings are not
useful in telling us about the health risks.
This is why CDPH does not recommend testing for mold, such as measuring mold spores
in the air.

DocuSign Envelope ID: BEBBB34E - 2815-40EE - A88B - 704908D522A5 Causes of Building
Dampness that Can Allow Mold to Grow The dampness that is necessary for indoor mold
to grow can come from either inside or outside a building.
Indoor sources include: " leaking or burst water pipes, for instance under sinks
inside walls not enough venting to the outside by open windows or exhaust fans in
places where water is used or moisture is produced (for example, bathrooms, laundry
areas, kitchens, and water heaters) condensation (water droplets) on cold surfaces
, including windows Outdoor sources include: water coming in through leaky roofs
or poorly - sealed windows, or from flooding damp, exposed dirt in crawl spaces
 outdoor surfaces that slope and drain water toward a building, including from a
downspout Fixing Dampness and Mold Problems The California Health & Safety Code (
HSC $ 17920.3) says that when dampness or visible mold (or certain other conditions
) in a home is a hazard to the health of occupants, the home is substandard and the
property owner must fix the conditions.
The Code excludes mold that is " minor and found on surfaces that accumulate moisture
as part of their properly functioning and intended use.
" CDPH recommends fixing dampness and mold problems as follows: identifying and correcting
the source of any water that may allow mold to grow  rapid drying or removal of damp
materials cleaning or removing mold and moldy materials as rapidly and safely as possible
Note: if a moldy area is simply bleached, cleaned, or painted over - without fixing
the source of the dampness - the mold is likely to grow again.

DocuSign Envelope ID: BEBBB34E - 2815-40EE - A88B - 7049080522A5 Renters in California
The California Health & Safety Code requires property owners to provide a rental unit
that is safe and healthy for the people living in it.
Prospective renters should look for obvious conditions that show dampness or mold
, and also less obvious signs like water leaks under the kitchen and bathroom sinks
or moldy odor in a sealed - up home.
Also look for conditions likely to cause future problems, like a bathroom that has
no working vent fan or no window that opens, or a clothes dryer without an outside
vent.
For renters who suspect there is dampness or mold: 1 Tell the property owner or manager
.
Early detection and correction of the dampness and mold problems can reduce the risks
to your health and prevent the problem from getting worse.
2.
If your property owner will not respond to your concerns in a reasonable amount of
time, contact your local (city or county) code enforcement agency and ask for a
code enforcement officer to inspect for violations.
Many dampness or mold problems in rental homes are the responsibility of the property
owner and must be addressed by them.
However, a code enforcement officer may determine that dampness or mold in a building
results from a tenant's actions or inactions - for instance, not using available
bathroom ventilation during showers.
3.
If the local inspector determines there is a violation, they can require the property
owner to correct the problem.
" Additional Resources For general information on dampness and mold and a list of
local code enforcement agencies, with a focus on dampness and mold, see www.cdph.ca.gov/iag/mold
.
To see an animated video series, Mold in the Home, visit www.cdph.ca.gov/mold.
Property owners must provide a rental unit that is safe and healthy for the people
living in it.
Tenants must notify property owners of any dampness or mold problems.
