These responses are made only for the purpose of the within action.
Each response or answer is subject to all objections as to competence, relevance
, materiality, propriety, admissibility and any other objections and grounds that
would require the exclusion of any statement herein if any document was asked of,
or if any statement contained therein were made by a witness present and testifying
in court, all of which objections and grounds are reserved and may be interposed
at the time of trial.
Plaintiff is Responding to all Requests to the extent that information has become
known by it.
However, this Responding Party's discovery, investigation and preparation for trial
of this matter has not been completed as of the date of these responses, and, therefore
, Plaintiff does not purport to state anything more than information presently known
and discovered by it.
Plaintiff, in responding to these Requests, reserves the right to continue discovery
and investigation in this matter for facts, witnesses and supporting data that may
recall information which, if it had presently within its knowledge, would be included
in these responses.
For example, to the extent that any request calls for the identification of all documents
, " it is responded to fully insofar as information is presently available to Plaintiff
, and Plaintiff is not precluded from presenting at trial information discovered after
the date of the response of this request.
This preliminary statement is incorporated into each of the responses set forth below
.
GENERAL OBJECTIONS To avoid repetition in setting forth specific objections to interrogatories
, Responding Party sets forth and incorporates the following objections to Responding
Party's each and every 26 response.
27 28 A.
RELEVANCY OBJECTION PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS -
2

--- Page 3 ---
1 2 Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory, in whole or in
part, seeks the disclosure of information that is neither relevant to the subject
matter of the action nor reasonably 3 calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.
4 B.
CONFIDENTIALITY / PRIVACY OBJECTION 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Responding Party
objects on the basis that the interrogatory seeks the disclosure of confidential information
and constitutes an attempt to invade the personal and / or financial privacy of certain
individuals or persons.
C.
OVERBREADTH AND BURDEN OBJECTION Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
is overbroad, burdensome and oppressive in that they seek the disclosure of information
that has little or no practical benefit to Propounding Party while placing an unwarranted
burden or expense on the Responding Party in ascertaining such information.
Further, such interrogatory is so broadly drawn that although it may include some
relevant information within its scope, it includes information that is irrelevant
or immaterial to the instant action.
Such interrogatory seeks information which is cumulative and / or would require the
compilation of extensive and detailed information from numerous 18 potential sources
, many of which is not easily identifiable or available.
A search for all such 19 information will in many instances involve enormous amounts
of time by Responding Party.
Further, the interrogatory is so overbroad such that it is uncertain what information
is sought.
D.
AMBIGUITY OBJECTION 20 21 22 23 24 25 122 26 27 28 Responding Party objects on the
basis that the interrogatory is phrased in language that is vague, ambiguous, and
uncertain such that Responding Party is unable to ascertain what information is sought
and in order to respond to this interrogatory, Responding Party would have to speculate
as to Propounding Party's intended meaning.
E.
AVAILABILITY OBJECTION Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
is equally accessible to all parties or is more accessible to the Propounding Party
or which is maintained primarily by persons or PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE TO
REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS - 3

--- Page 4 ---
1 entities other than Responding Party.
2 F.
IMPROPER FORM OBJECTION 3 4 5 6 Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
is phrased in improper form because the interrogatory is not “ full and complete in
and of itself ";
or because it contains subpart, “ compound, conjunctive or disjunctive ” question
, such that the interrogatory does not comply with the requirements of California
Code of Civil Procedure §2030.060 7 G.
LEGAL CONCLUSION OBJECTION 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Responding Party objects on the basis
that the interrogatory calls for a legal conclusion.
H.
ATTORNEY WORK - PRODUCT OBJECTION Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
, in whole or in part, seeks disclosure of information that is protected under the
attorney work - product doctrine.
I.
MARITAL PRIVILEGE OBJECTION Responding Party objects on the basis that the request
, in whole or in part, seeks disclosure of information that is protected under marital
privilege.
