INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM - 010 To Plaintiffs and Others
Filing First Papers.
If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you
must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet
contained on page 1.
This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of
cases filed.
You must complete items 1 through 6 on the sheet.
In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case
.
If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1
, check the more specific one.
If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the
primary cause of action.
To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each
case type in item 1 are provided below.
A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper.
Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject
a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California
Rules of Court.
To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases.
A " collections case " under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money
owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $ 25,000, exclusive of interest
and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or
money was acquired on credit.
A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages
, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal
property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment.
The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that
it will be exempt from the general time - for - service requirements and case management
rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading.
A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and
obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740.
To Parties in Complex Cases.
In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate
whether the case is complex.
If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules
of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and
2.
If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with
the complaint on all parties to the action.
A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder
in the plaintiff's designation, a counter - designation that the case is not complex
, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that the case is complex
.
