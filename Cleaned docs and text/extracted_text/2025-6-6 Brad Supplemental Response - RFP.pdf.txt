MARTINEZ (" Responding Party ") hereby provides its supplemental responses to JENNIFER
BURBANK'S (“ Propounding Party ") Request for Production of Documents (Set One
) as follows: PRELIMINARY STATEMENT These responses are made only for the purpose
of the within action.
Each response or answer is subject to all objections as to competence, relevance
, materiality, propriety, admissibility and any other objections and grounds that
would require the exclusion of any statement herein if any document was asked of,
or if any statement contained therein were made by a witness present and testifying
in court, all of which objections and grounds are reserved and may be interposed
at the time of trial.
Defendant is responding to all Requests to the extent that information has become
known by him.
However, this Responding Party's discovery, investigation and preparation for trial
of this matter has not been completed as of the date of these responses, and, therefore
, Defendant does not purport to state anything more than information presently known
and discovered by him.
Defendant, in responding to these Requests, reserves the right to continue discovery
and 19 investigation in this matter for facts, witnesses and supporting data that
may recall information 20 21 22 23 which, if he had presently within his knowledge
, would be included in these responses.
For example, to the extent that any request calls for the identification of " all
documents, ” it is responded to fully insofar as information is presently available
to Defendant, and Defendant is not 24 || precluded from presenting at trial information
discovered after the date of the response of this 25 request.
26 27 28 This preliminary statement is incorporated into each of the responses set
forth below.
GENERAL OBJECTIONS PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF
DOCUMENTS TO PLAINTIFF - 2

--- Page 3 ---
To avoid repetition in setting forth specific objections to interrogatories, Responding
Party sets forth and incorporates the following objections to Responding Party's each
and every 1 2 3 response.
4 5 6 7 A.
RELEVANCE OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory,
in whole or in part, seeks the disclosure of information that is neither relevant
to the subject matter of the action nor reasonably 8 calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence.
9 B.
CONFIDENTIALITY / PRIVACY OBJECTION 10 11 12 Responding party objects on the basis
that the interrogatory seeks the disclosure of confidential information and constitutes
an attempt to invade the personal and / or financial privacy of certain 13 individuals
or persons.
14 15 16 C.
OVERBREADTH AND BURDEN OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
is overbroad, burdensome and 17 oppressive in that they seek the disclosure of information
that has little or no practical benefit to 18 Propounding Party while placing an unwarranted
burden or expense on the Responding Party in 19 20 21 22 ascertaining such information
.
Further, such interrogatory is so broadly drawn that although it may include some
relevant information within its scope, it includes information that is irrelevant
or immaterial to the instant action.
Such interrogatory seeks information which is cumulative 23 and / or would require
the compilation of extensive and detailed information from numerous 24 25 2227 26
27 28 potential sources, many of which is not easily identifiable or available.
A search for all such information will in many instances involve enormous amounts
of time by Responding Party.
Further, the interrogatory is so overbroad such that it is uncertain what information
is sought.
D.
AMBIGUITY OBJECTION PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF
DOCUMENTS TO PLAINTIFF - 3

--- Page 4 ---
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is phrased
in language that is vague, ambiguous, and uncertain such that Responding Party is
unable to ascertain what information is sought and in order to respond to this interrogatory
, Responding Party would have to speculate as to Propounding Party's intended meaning
.
E.
AVAILABILITY OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
is equally accessible to all parties or is more accessible to the Propounding Party
or which is maintained primarily by persons or 9 entities other than Responding Party
.
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 F.
IMPROPER FORM OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
is phrased in improper form because the interrogatory is not “ full and complete in
and of itself ";
or because it contains subpart, “ compound, conjunctive or disjunctive ” question
, such that the interrogatory does not comply with the requirements of California
Code of Civil Procedure §2030.060 G.
LEGAL CONCLUSION OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
calls for a legal conclusion.
H.
ATTORNEY WORK - PRODUCT OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
, in whole or in part, 21 22 23 24 25 28 27 seeks disclosure of information that
is protected under the attorney work - product doctrine.
I.
MARITAL PRIVILEGE OBJECTION Responding party objects on the basis that the request
, in whole or in part, seeks disclosure of information that is protected under marital
privilege.
REQUEST NO.
