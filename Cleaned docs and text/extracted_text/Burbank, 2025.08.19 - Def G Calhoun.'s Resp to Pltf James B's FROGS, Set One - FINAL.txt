CALHOUN AS TRUSTEE OF THE GAIL D CALHOUN FAMILY TRUST'S REPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JAMES BURBANK'S FORM INTERROGATORIES , SET ONE

--- Page 2 --- 1 ( " Responding Party " ) hereby submits these objections and responses to the First Set of Form 2 Interrogatories propounded by Plaintiff JAMES BURBANK ( “ Propounding Party ” ) as follows :

3 4 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT Responding Party has not completed its investigation of the facts relating to this case , its 5 discovery or its preparation for trial .

All responses and objections contained herein are based only 6 || upon information that is presently available to and specifically known by Responding Party .

It is 7 || anticipated that further discovery , independent investigation , legal research and analysis will 8 supply additional facts and add meaning to known facts , as well as establish entirely new factual 9 conclusions and legal contentions , all of which may lead to substantial additions to , changes in and 10 variations from the responses set forth herein .

11 These responses , while based on diligent inquiry and investigation by Responding Party , 12 reflect only the current state of Responding Party's knowledge , understanding , and belief , based 13 upon the information reasonably available to it at this time .

As this action proceeds , and further 14 || investigation and discovery are conducted , additional or different facts and information could be 15 revealed to Responding Party .

Moreover , Responding Party anticipates that Propounding Party 16 may make legal or factual contentions presently unknown to and unforeseen by Responding Party 17 which may require Responding Party to adduce further facts in rebuttal to such contentions .

18 Consequently , Responding Party may not yet have knowledge and may not fully understand the 19 significance of information potentially pertinent to these responses .

Accordingly , these responses 20 are provided without prejudice to Responding Party's right to rely upon and use any information 21 that it subsequently discovers , or that was omitted from these responses as a result of mistake , 22 inadvertence , surprise , or excusable neglect .

Without in any way obligating itself to do so , 23 Responding Party reserves the right to modify , supplement , revise , or amend these responses , and 24 to correct any inadvertent errors or omissions which may be contained herein , in light of the 25 information that Responding Party may subsequently obtain or discover .

26 Nothing in this response should be construed as an admission by Responding Party with 27 respect to the admissibility or relevance of any fact or document , or of the truth or accuracy of any 28 characterization or statement of any kind contained in Propounding Party's interrogatories .

2 DEFENDANT GAIL D.

CALHOUN AS TRUSTEE OF THE GAIL D CALHOUN FAMILY TRUST'S REPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JAMES BURBANK'S FORM INTERROGATORIES , SET ONE

--- Page 3 --- 1 Each of the following responses is made solely for the purpose of this action .

Each 2 response is subject to all objections as to relevance , materiality , and admissibility , and to any and 3 all objections on any ground that would require exclusion of any response if it were introduced in 4 court .

All objections and grounds are expressly reserved and may be interposed at the time of 5 trial , hearing , or otherwise .

Furthermore , each of the objections contained herein is incorporated 6 by reference as though fully set forth in each response .

7 The following objections and responses are made without prejudice to Responding Party's 8 right to produce at trial , or otherwise , evidence regarding any subsequently discovered 9 information .

Responding Party accordingly reserves the right to modify and amend any and all 10 responses herein as research is completed and contentions are made .

11 Nothing contained herein is to be construed as a waiver of any attorney - client privilege , 12 work product doctrine , or any other applicable privilege or doctrine .

To the extent any 13 interrogatory may be construed as calling for disclosure of information protected from discovery 14 by the attorney - client privilege , the work product doctrine , or any other privilege or protection , a 15 continuing objection to each and every such interrogatory is hereby interposed .

16 17 18 GENERAL OBJECTIONS TO INTERROGATORIES Responding Party generally objects to the Interrogatories as follows :

A.

Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they seek to 19 elicit information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of this action , nor reasonably 20 calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence .

21 B.

Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they are 22 unreasonably overbroad in scope , and thus burdensome and oppressive , in that each such 23 interrogatory seeks information pertaining to items and matters that are not relevant to the subject 24 matter of this action , or , if relevant , so remote therefrom as to make its disclosure of little or no 25 practical benefit to Propounding Party , while placing a wholly unwarranted burden and expense on 26 Responding Party in locating , reviewing and producing the requested information .

27 C.

Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they are 28 burdensome and oppressive , in that ascertaining the information necessary to respond to them 3 DEFENDANT GAIL D.

CALHOUN AS TRUSTEE OF THE GAIL D CALHOUN FAMILY TRUST'S REPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JAMES BURBANK'S FORM INTERROGATORIES , SET ONE

--- Page 4 --- 1 would require the review and compilation of information from multiple locations , and voluminous 2 records and files , thereby involving substantial time of employees of Responding Party and great 3 expense to Responding Party , whereas the information sought to be obtained by Propounding 4 Party would be of little use or benefit to Propounding Party .

150 7 D.

Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they are 6 vague , uncertain , overbroad , and without limitation as to time or specific subject matter .

E.

Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they seek 8 information at least some of which is protected by the attorney - client privilege or the attorney 9 work - product doctrine , or both .

10 11 F.

Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they seek to have Responding Party furnish information that is a matter of the public record , and therefore is 12 equally available to the Propounding Party as they are to Responding Party .

13 G.

Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they seek to 14 have Responding Party furnish information that is proprietary to Responding Party and contain 15 confidential information .

16 H.

Responding Party objects to the interrogatories , and to any individual interrogatory set 17 forth therein , to the extent that they are compound and constitute an impermissible effort to 18 circumvent the 35 special interrogatory limit set by Section 2030.030 of the California Code of 19 Civil Procedure .

20 I.

Responding Party expressly incorporates each of the foregoing General Objections into 21 each specific response to the interrogatories set forth below as if set forth in full therein .

An answer to an interrogatory is not intended to be a waiver of any applicable specific or general 23 objection to such interrogatory .

24 25 27 222222 Without waiver of the foregoing , Responding Party further responds as follows :

8 RESPONSE TO FORM INTERROGATORY NO .

14.2 :

9 Objection .

Responding Party objects to this interrogatory in that it seeks information that is 10 protected by the attorney work product doctrine and attorney client privilege .

Further , this 11 interrogatory is vague and ambiguous as to the definition of " INCIDENT ” as per the Complaint 12 there was not one isolated incident .

In addition , Responding Party objects on the grounds that this 13 interrogatory calls for an expert opinion and / or legal conclusion .

14 Subject to and without waiving the foregoing , Responding Party provides the following 15 response :

Not to Responding Party's knowledge .

27 RESPONSE TO FORM INTERROGATORY NO .

15.1 :

28 Responding Party objects to the interrogatory on the grounds that it requires that 22 DEFENDANT GAIL D.

CALHOUN AS TRUSTEE OF THE GAIL D CALHOUN FAMILY TRUST'S REPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JAMES BURBANK'S FORM INTERROGATORIES , SET ONE

--- Page 23 --- 1 Responding Party set forth its legal contentions , thus violating the attorney work product doctrine .

2 Responding Party objects to this request to the extent the term “ material ” is vague and ambiguous , 3 requiring Responding Party to speculate as to the response sought .

Responding Party has filed a 4 general denial of the Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §431.30 .

All affirmative 5 defenses alleged by Responding Party are made for the specific purpose of preserving Responding 6 Party's rights under a number of possible scenarios which may develop before or during trial .

The 7 || affirmative defenses may or may not become relevant depending on the information 8 || revealed / obtained during the litigation and at trial .

Responding Party is entitled to do this under 9 the Code of Civil Procedure .

An investigation has been undertaken on behalf of Responding Party ; 10 however , the nature and scope of this investigation and the attendant work product , the identity of 11 any of Responding Party's attorney's agent ( s ) ( prior to , if applicable , designation as an expert 13 12 witness pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §2034 ) and the identity of any individual ( s ) who may or may not have been contacted by Responding Party's attorneys , or their agents , is protected by 14 privacy , work product , and attorney - client privileges as embodied in Article I , Section 1 of the 15 California Constitution , Code of Civil Procedure §2018 , Evidence Code §950 , et .

seq .

, and case 16 law , including Soltani - Rastegar v .

Superior Court , ( 1989 ) 208 Cal.App.3d 424.

Responding Party 17 also objects to this Request on the grounds that it is premature as Responding Party has not had 18 sufficient opportunity to complete its investigation and discovery .

Further , expert designations and 19 depositions have not taken place , and information obtained during deposition , as well as 20 information presented at trial may support the denials and affirmative defenses raised by 21 Responding Party .

Many of the defenses are primarily based on expert witness testimony , and / or 22 facts gleamed from such testimony .

Responding Party's procedural defenses are raised in order to 23 preserve the viability and availability of these defenses pending further discovery and trial .

Subject to and without waiving these objections , Responding Party states as follows :

24 25 222222 a .

Responding Party filed a number of affirmative defenses , which may become 26 relevant as the discovery process reveals more information .

This is done as a matter of course to 27 preserve all possible defenses , including those of which Responding Party may still be unaware of 28 at the time the Answer was filed .

These affirmative defenses asserted by the Responding Party 23 DEFENDANT GAIL D.

CALHOUN AS TRUSTEE OF THE GAIL D CALHOUN FAMILY TRUST'S REPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JAMES BURBANK'S FORM INTERROGATORIES , SET ONE

--- Page 24 --- 1 may or may not become relevant depending upon the information revealed through the course of 2 discovery in this matter .

Furthermore , some of these affirmative defenses set forth legal defenses 3 || that are not factual .

Further , Plaintiffs ' complaint provides insufficient details to identify any 4 alleged breaches or wrongful conduct , and public records do not reflect any relevant complaints , 5 so Defendants are unaware of any specific conditions as alleged in the Complaint .

Affirmative 6 defenses raised in Responding Party's Answer to Plaintiff's Complaint have been asserted in order 7 to not waive those affirmative defenses .

California Academy of Sciences v .

County of Fresno 8 ( 1987 ) 192 Cal.App.3d 1436 , 1442.

Further , those affirmative defenses were pled in order to 9 protect Responding Party's affirmative defenses in the event discovery and investigation reveal a 10 basis for them .

Discovery has not yet been completed , and the facts upon which Responding 11 Party's affirmative defenses are based have yet to be fully developed .

12 13 b .

C.

Plaintiffs ; and Defendant , who may be contacted through counsel of record ; Pursuant to C.C.P.

§ 2030.230 , Responding Party directs Propounding Party to the 14 following documents :

Plaintiffs ' document production ; and Responding Party's document 15 production .

16 Additionally , as the discovery phase is still open and active , it is premature to make a 17 determination as to which affirmative defenses relative to these issues are appropriate .

Responding 18 Party presently has insufficient knowledge or information on which to form a belief as to whether 19 Responding Party may have additional affirmative defenses .

Responding Party has therefore 20 reserved the right to assert those affirmative defenses which discovery would indicate are 21 appropriate .

Discovery is ongoing and Responding Party reserves the right to amend , modify , or 23 supplement the response as additional information is revealed through the discovery process .
