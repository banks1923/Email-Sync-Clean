1 TRUST (" Responding Party ") hereby submits these objections and responses to
the First Set of 2 Special Interrogatories propounded by Plaintiff JAMES BURBANK (
“ Propounding Party ") as 3 follows: 4 150 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT Responding Party
has not completed its investigation of the facts relating to this case, its 6 ||
discovery or its preparation for trial.
All responses and objections contained herein are based only 7 upon information that
is presently available to and specifically known by Responding Party.
It is 8 anticipated that further discovery, independent investigation, legal research
and analysis will 9 supply additional facts and add meaning to known facts, as well
as establish entirely new factual 10 conclusions and legal contentions, all of which
may lead to substantial additions to, changes in and 11 variations from the responses
set forth herein.
12 These responses, while based on diligent inquiry and investigation by Responding
Party, 13 reflect only the current state of Responding Party's knowledge, understanding
, and belief, based 14 upon the information reasonably available to it at this time
.
As this action proceeds, and further 15 investigation and discovery are conducted
, additional or different facts and information could be 16 revealed to Responding
Party.
Moreover, Responding Party anticipates that Propounding Party 17 may make legal or
factual contentions presently unknown to and unforeseen by Responding Party 18 which
may require Responding Party to adduce further facts in rebuttal to such contentions
.
19 Consequently, Responding Party may not yet have knowledge and may not fully understand
the 20 significance of information potentially pertinent to these responses.
Accordingly, these responses 21 are provided without prejudice to Responding Party's
right to rely upon and use any information 22 that it subsequently discovers, or
that was omitted from these responses as a result of mistake, 23 inadvertence, surprise
, or excusable neglect.
Without in any way obligating itself to do so, 24 Responding Party reserves the right
to modify, supplement, revise, or amend these responses, and 25 to correct any
inadvertent errors or omissions which may be contained herein, in light of the 26
information that Responding Party may subsequently obtain or discover.
27 Nothing in this response should be construed as an admission by Responding Party
with 28 respect to the admissibility or relevance of any fact or document, or of
the truth or accuracy of any 2 DEFENDANT GAIL D.

1 characterization or statement of any kind contained in Propounding Party's interrogatories
.
2 Each of the following responses is made solely for the purpose of this action.
Each 3 response is subject to all objections as to relevance, materiality, and admissibility
, and to any and 4 all objections on any ground that would require exclusion of any
response if it were introduced in 5 court.
All objections and grounds are expressly reserved and may be interposed at the time
of 6 | trial, hearing, or otherwise.
Furthermore, each of the objections contained herein is incorporated 7 by reference
as though fully set forth in each response.
8 The following objections and responses are made without prejudice to Responding
Party's 9 right to produce at trial, or otherwise, evidence regarding any subsequently
discovered 10 information.
Responding Party accordingly reserves the right to modify and amend any and all 11
12 responses herein as research is completed and contentions are made.
Nothing contained herein is to be construed as a waiver of any attorney - client privilege
, 13 work product doctrine, or any other applicable privilege or doctrine.
To the extent any 14 interrogatory may be construed as calling for disclosure of information
protected from discovery 15 by the attorney - client privilege, the work product
doctrine, or any other privilege or protection, a 16 continuing objection to each
and every such interrogatory is hereby interposed.
17 18 19 GENERAL OBJECTIONS TO INTERROGATORIES Responding Party generally objects
to the Interrogatories as follows: A.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
seek to 20 elicit information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of this
action, nor reasonably 21 calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence
.
22 B.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
are 23 unreasonably overbroad in scope, and thus burdensome and oppressive, in that
each such 24 interrogatory seeks information pertaining to items and matters that
are not relevant to the subject 25 matter of this action, or, if relevant, so remote
therefrom as to make its disclosure of little or no 26 practical benefit to Propounding
Party, while placing a wholly unwarranted burden and expense on 27 Responding Party
in locating, reviewing and producing the requested information.
28 C.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
are 3 DEFENDANT GAIL D.
CALHOUN, AS TRUSTEE OF THE GAIL D CALHOUN FAMILY TRUST'S RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JAMES
BURBANK'S SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE

--- Page 4 ---
1 burdensome and oppressive, in that ascertaining the information necessary to respond
to them 2 would require the review and compilation of information from multiple locations
, and voluminous 3 records and files, thereby involving substantial time of employees
of Responding Party and great 4 expense to Responding Party, whereas the information
sought to be obtained by Propounding 5 Party would be of little use or benefit to
Propounding Party.
6 8 D.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
are 7 vague, uncertain, overbroad, and without limitation as to time or specific
subject matter.
E.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
seek 9 information at least some of which is protected by the attorney - client privilege
or the attorney 10 work - product doctrine, or both.
11 F.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
seek to 12 have Responding Party furnish information that is a matter of the public
record, and therefore is 13 equally available to the Propounding Party as they are
to Responding Party.
14 G.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
seek to 15 have Responding Party furnish information that is proprietary to Responding
Party and contain 16 confidential information.
17 H.
Responding Party objects to the interrogatories, and to any individual interrogatory
set 18 forth therein, to the extent that they are compound and constitute an impermissible
effort to 19 circumvent the 35 special interrogatory limit set by Section 2030.030
of the California Code of 20 Civil Procedure.
21 I.
Responding Party expressly incorporates each of the foregoing General Objections into
22 each specific response to the interrogatories set forth below as if set forth in
full therein.
An 23 answer to an interrogatory is not intended to be a waiver of any applicable
specific or general 24 objection to such interrogatory.
25 Without waiver of the foregoing, Responding Party further responds as follows
