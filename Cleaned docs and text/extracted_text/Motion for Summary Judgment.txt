MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 I.
STATEMENT OF FACTS Defendants Jennifer Burbank and Defendant James Burbank signed
a lease agreement with Plaintiff for the rental of the premises located at 518 N Stoneman
Ave,.
Alhambra, CA 91801 (" Premises ”) on September 4, 2023.
[ James Burbank Decl.
¶ 3;
Exhibit “ A ” ] [ Jennifer Burbank Decl.
¶ 3 Exhibit “ A ” ] [ Complaint Exhibit “ 1 ” ].
This action by Plaintiff is based on a 60 - day notice to terminate tenancy alleging
that the owner's father will move into the premises.
[ Plaintiff's Complaint: Exhibit “ 2 ” ] The notice states that it is “ being served
pursuant to California Civil Code section 1946.2 (a) (i).
" id.
In the notice, Plaintiff elected to waive the last month's rent as the form of relocation
assistance, rather than providing a direct relocation payment to Defendants.
Id.
However, although Plaintiff elected to waive the last month's rent, the notice fails
to comply with the strict statutory requirement that it specify the exact amount of
rent being waived.
Id.
The notice 15 merely states that the " Landlord agrees to waive last month's rent
" without identifying the specific dollar amount waived.
Id.
16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 On May 20, 2025, Defendant Jennifer Burbank propounded
her first set of Form Interrogatories – Unlawful Detainer on Plaintiff Bradford M.
Martinez (“ Plaintiff Martinez ”).
[ Teshale Decl.
12;
Exhibit “ B ” ].
Among these interrogatories were Form Interrogatories No.
74.1, 74.2, and 74.3, which address local laws limiting the right to evict tenants
.
Id.
Plaintiff's Martinez's responses confirm that the premises and defendants tenancy
is protected by the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 / California Civil Code section
1946.2, and that no exemption is applicable to defendant's tenancy.
[ Teshale Decl.
¶3-4;
Exhibit “ C ” & “ D ” ].
  Form Interrogatory 74.1 asks: “ Is there an ordinance or other local law in this
jurisdiction which limits the right to evict tenants?
" Plaintiff responded: “ Yes.
” Form Interrogatory 74.2 asks: " For the ordinance or other local law limiting the
right to evict tenants, state: (a) The title or number of the law;
(b) The locality.
" Plaintiff 27 28 3 Summary Lawyaw Package ID: Defendant's Motion for Sum81215119a

--- Page 4 ---
1 2 3  4 5 6 7 8 9 responded: " (a) The Tenant Protection Act of 2019, codified
at California Civil Code section 1946.2;
(b) California.
" Form Interrogatory 74.3 asks: “ Do you contend that the rental unit is exempt from
the eviction provisions of the ordinance or other local law identified in section
74.2?
If so, state the facts upon which you base your contention.
” Plaintiff responded: “ No.
” [ Teshale Decl.
¶¶2-3;
Exhibits “ B " & " C " ].
Plaintiff is correct in this response.
Under the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, a condominium or single - family residence
is only exempt if the lease agreement contains the statutory notice to the tenant
of such exemption.
Here, the standard lease agreement includes a checkbox to 10 designate such exemption
, but the box was not checked.
[ James.
Burbank Decl.
¶ 3;
Exhibit “ A ” ] 11 [ Jennifer Burbank Decl.
¶ 3 Exhibit “ A ” ] [ Complaint Exhibit “ 1 ” ].
As a result, the tenancy is not exempt and remains protected under the Tenant Protection
Act of 2019.
12 13 14 Therefore, it is undisputed between the parties that the Tenant Protection
Act of 2019 applies to this tenancy, and that Plaintiff elected to waive the last
month's rent in lieu of relocation 15 assistance but failed to state the specific
amount waived as required.
16 17 18 III.
LEGAL STANDARD A.
THE STANDARD FOR A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT Under California Code of Civil Procedure
Section 437c, a party may move for summary 19 judgment on the basis that the action
has " no merit.
” C.C.P.
§ 437c (a).
" A cause of action has no 20 merit if...
[ o ] ne or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established.
" C.C.P.
§ 21 437c (o).
Once the defendant has met his burden of showing that “ one or more elements of the
22 23 24 25 26 27 28 cause of action.
.
.
cannot be established, ” the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable
issue of material fact exists for that cause of action.
C.C.P.
§ 437c (p) (2).
This case involves the application of law to undisputed facts and thus there is no
triable issue of fact because “ the interpretation of statutes is a matter of law
for the courts to decide.
" Massa v.
Southern Cal.
Rapid Transit Dist.
(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1220.
Code of Civil Procedure Section 1170.7 provides that a motion for summary judgment
can be made after the answer is filed, upon five days notice, and shall be decided
on the same 5 Defendant's Motion for Su81215e119a Lawyaw Package ID:

--- Page 5 ---
1 2 3 4 5 6 basis as a motion under Section 437c.
Under Section 437c, a summary judgment motion " shall be granted if all the papers
submitted show that there is no triable issue of material fact and that the moving
party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
” C.C.P.
§ 437c (c) Because an unlawful detainer involves a forfeiture of the tenants ' right
to possession, California's appellate courts have decided that “ every intendment
and presumption is against the person seeking to enforce the forfeiture ” through
the unlawful detainer process.

ARGUMENT 9 10 A.
THE PREMISES AND TENANTS ARE PROTECTED BY THE TENANT PROTECTION ACT OF 2019 CIVIL
CODE § 1946.2 ET SEQ.
11 i.
The Tenancy is Covered by the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 The
Tenant Protection Act of 2019, codified at Civil Code § 1946.2, generally applies
to tenants who have continuously and lawfully occupied a residential real property
for 12 months or more, or where at least one tenant has occupied the premises for
24 months if additional adult tenants are added during the tenancy.
(§ 1946.2 (a).
) Certain properties are exempt, including, single - family homes or condos if the
owner is not a corporate entity and has provided the required exemption notice, (
§ 1946.2 (e).
) Absent a valid exemption, tenants meeting the 19 occupancy requirements are protected
and cannot be evicted without just cause.
20 Here, both tenants moved into the premises more than 12 months ago.
[ James.

Exhibit “ A ” ] [ Jennifer Burbank Decl.
¶ 3 Exhibit “ A ” ] [ Complaint Exhibit “ 1 ” ].
The notice 22 22 itself states it is " being served pursuant to California Civil Code
1946.2 (A) (i).
” [ Complaint 23 Exhibit “ 2 ” ] Additionally, Plaintiff Martinez stated in verified
discovery responses that the 24 premises is covered by the Tenant Protection Act of
2019: [ Teshale Decl.

Act of 2019, CODEFIED AT California Civil Code Section 1946.2 (b) California [

¶¶2-4;
Exhibits “ B ”, ” C ” & ” D ].
Plaintiff's own discovery responses confirm that the Tenant Protection Act applies
.
[ Teshale Decl.
¶¶;
Exhibits “ B ” & ” C ” ].
There is no dispute between the parties as to its applicability, and thus the property
is subject to the TPA's just cause requirements.
11 12 ii.
The Tenancy is not Exempt from the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 13 14 15 16 17 Under
Civil Code § 1946.2 (e) (8), single - family homes and condominiums that are
alienable separate from other units are exempt from the just cause requirements only
if: (1) the owner is not a real estate investment trust, corporation, or LLC
with a corporate member;
and (2) the tenants have been provided the statutory exemption notice.
For tenancies commenced or renewed on or after July 1, 2020, the required exemption
notice “ must be provided in the rental 18 agreement ”.
(§ 1946.2 (e) (8) (B) (iii).
) Without strict compliance with these notice requirements, the exemption does not
apply and the tenancy remains protected under the Tenant Protection 19 20 21 Act.
Here, the tenancy commenced on September 8, 2023, after July 1, 2020.

[ Teshale Decl.
¶¶;
Exhibits “ B ” & ” C ” ].
Accordingly, it is undisputed that the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 applies to this
tenancy, and Defendants are entitled to all protections afforded under that law.
B.
THE NOTICE OF TERMINATION IS VOID BECAUSE IT FAILS TO STATE THE AMOUNT OF RENT WAIVED
AS REQUIRED BY CIVIL CODE § 1946.2 (d) (2) AND § 1946.2 (d) (4).
Under Civil Code § 1946.2 (d) (2), when an owner elects to waive rent for the
final month of a tenancy terminated for no - fault just cause, “ the notice shall
state the amount of rent waived and that no rent is due for the final month of the
tenancy.
” (Civil Code § 1946.2 (d) (4)) mandates strict compliance with these requirements
, stating that “ [ a ] n owner's failure to strictly comply with this subdivision
shall render the notice of termination void.
” Thus, if a notice merely states that last month's rent is waived without specifying
the dollar amount waived, it fails to strictly comply with § 1946.2 (d) and is
void.
Here, the notice states that the landlord elects to waive last month's rent but fails
to specify the amount of rent being waived.
[ Complaint Exhibit “ 2 ” ] As a result, the notice does not strictly comply with
Civil Code § 1946.2 (d) (2) and is void under § 1946.2 (d) (4).
IV.
CONCLUSION For the forgoing reasons, Defendant respectfully requests that this court
grants this Motion and issues judgment for Defendant Dated: July 1, 2025 Respectfully

OF REALTORS® DISCLOSURE REGARDING REAL ESTATE AGENCY RELATIONSHIP (As required by
the Civil Code) (C.A.R.
Form AD, Revised 12/21) G3 COLDWELL BANKER REALTY ■ (If checked) This form is
being provided in connection with a transaction for a leasehold interest exceeding
one year as per Civil Code section 2079.13 (j), (k), and (I).
When you enter into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate
transaction, you should from the outset understand what type of agency relationship
or representation you wish to have with the agent in the transaction.
SELLER'S AGENT A Seller's agent under a listing agreement with the Seller acts as
the agent for the Seller only.
A Seller's agent or a subagent of that agent has the following affirmative obligations
: To the Seller: A Fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty
in dealings with the Seller.
To the Buyer and the Seller: (a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care
in performance of the agent's duties.
(b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith.
(c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value
or desirability of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention
and observation of, the parties.
An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential information obtained
from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above
.
BUYER'S AGENT A Buyer's agent can, with a Buyer's consent, agree to act as agent
for the Buyer only.
In these situations, the agent is not the Seller's agent, even if by agreement the
agent may receive compensation for services rendered, either in full or in part from
the Seller.
An agent acting only for a Buyer has the following affirmative obligations: To the
Buyer: A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings
with the Buyer.
To the Buyer and the Seller: (a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care
in performance of the agent's duties.
(b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith.
(c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value
or desirability of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention
and observation of, the parties.
An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential information obtained
from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above
.
AGENT REPRESENTING BOTH SELLER AND BUYER A real estate agent, either acting directly
or through one or more salespersons and broker associates, can legally be the agent
of both the Seller and the Buyer in a transaction, but only with the knowledge and
consent of both the Seller and the Buyer.
In a dual agency situation, the agent has the following affirmative obligations to
both the Seller and the Buyer: (a) A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity
, honesty and loyalty in the dealings with either the Seller or the Buyer.
(b) Other duties to the Seller and the Buyer as stated above in their respective
sections.
In representing both Seller and Buyer, a dual agent may not, without the express
permission of the respective party, disclose to the other party confidential information
, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either the Buyer's or Seller's
financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information
that may impact price, including the Seller's willingness to accept a price less
than the listing price or the Buyer's willingness to pay a price greater than the
price offered.
SELLER AND BUYER RESPONSIBILITIES Either the purchase agreement or a separate document
will contain a confirmation of which agent is representing you and whether that agent
is representing you exclusively in the transaction or acting as a dual agent.
Please pay attention to that confirmation to make sure it accurately reflects your
understanding of your agent's role.
The above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Seller
or Buyer from the responsibility to protect his or her own interests.
You should carefully read all agreements to assure that they adequately express your
understanding of the transaction.
A real estate agent is a person qualified to advise about real estate.
If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent professional.
If you are a Buyer, you have the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect yourself
, including as to those facts about the property which are known to you or within
your diligent attention and observation.
Both Sellers and Buyers should strongly consider obtaining tax advice from a competent
professional because the federal and state tax consequences of a transaction can be
complex and subject to change.
Throughout your real property transaction you may receive more than one disclosure
form, depending upon the number of agents assisting in the transaction.
The law requires each agent with whom you have more than a casual relationship to
present you with this disclosure form.
You should read its contents each time it is presented to you, considering the relationship
between you and the real estate agent in your specific transaction.
This disclosure form includes the provisions of Sections 2079.13 to 2079.24, inclusive
, of the Civil Code set forth on page 2.
Read it carefully.

2079.18 (Repealed pursuant to AB - 1289) 2079.19 The payment of compensation or

or buyer.

as the result of a real estate transaction, and the terms of any such agreement shall

2079.20 Nothing in this article prevents an agent from selecting, as a condition
of the agent's employment, a specific form of agency relationship not specifically
prohibited by this article if the requirements of Section 2079.14 and Section 2079.17
are complied with.
2079.21 (a) A dual agent may not, without the express permission of the seller

the agency relationship at any time before the performance of the act which is the
object of the agency with the written consent of the parties to the agency relationship

employees from liability for their conduct in connection with acts governed by this
article or for any breach of a fiduciary duty or a duty of disclosure.

(C.A.R.
Form WFA, Revised 12/21) G COLDWELL BANKER REALTY (" Property ").
Property Address: 518 N Stoneman Ave.
, Alhambra, California 91801 WIRE FRAUD AND ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS ADVISORY:
The ability to communicate and conduct business electronically is a convenience and
reality in nearly all parts of our lives.
At the same time, it has provided hackers and scammers new opportunities for their
criminal activity.
Many businesses have been victimized and the real estate business is no exception
.
While wiring or electronically transferring funds is a welcome convenience, we all
need to exercise extreme caution.
Emails attempting to induce fraudulent wire transfers have been received and have
appeared to be legitimate.
Reports indicate that some hackers have been able to intercept emailed transfer instructions
, obtain account information and, by altering some of the data, redirect the funds
to a different account.
It also appears that some hackers were able to provide false phone numbers for verifying
the wiring or funds transfer instructions.
In those cases, the victim called the number provided to confirm the instructions
, and then unwittingly authorized a transfer to somewhere or someone other than the
intended recipient.
ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE ADVISED: 1.
Obtain phone numbers and account numbers only from Escrow Officers, Property Managers
, or Landlords at the beginning of the transaction.
2.
DO NOT EVER WIRE OR ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFER FUNDS PRIOR TO CALLING TO CONFIRM THE
TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS.
ONLY USE A PHONE NUMBER YOU WERE PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY.
Do not use any different phone number or account number included in any emailed transfer
instructions.
3.
Orally confirm the transfer instruction is legitimate and confirm the bank routing
number, account numbers and other codes before taking steps to transfer the funds
.
4.
Avoid sending personal information in emails or texts.
Provide such information in person or over the telephone directly to the Escrow Officer
, Property Manager, or Landlord.
5.
Take steps to secure the system you are using with your email account.
These steps include creating strong passwords, using secure WiFi, and not using
free services.
If you believe you have received questionable or suspicious wire or funds transfer
instructions, immediately notify your bank, and the other party, and the Escrow
Office, Landlord, or Property Manager.

OF REALTORS® CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT ADVISORY, DISCLOSURE AND NOTICE (C.A.R.
Form CCPA, Revised 12/22) G■ COLDWELL BANKER REALTY The California Consumer Privacy
Act (commencing with Civil Code § 1798.100) (“ CCPA "), as amended by California
voters in 2020, grants to California residents certain rights in their private,
personal information (" PI ") that is collected by companies with whom they do business
.
Under the CCPA, PI is defined broadly to encompass non - public records information
that could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to you.
Pl could potentially include photographs of, or sales information about, your property
.
During the process of buying and selling real estate your PI will be collected and
likely shared with others, including real estate licensees, a Multiple Listing Service
, real estate internet websites, service providers, lenders, and title and escrow
companies, to name several possibilities.
Businesses that are covered by the CCPA are required to grant you various rights in
your PI, including the right to know what PI is collected, the right to know what
PI is sold or shared and to whom, the right to request that the business correct
or delete your PI, the right to " opt out " or stop the transfer of your PI to others
, and the right to limit the use of certain Pl which is considered " sensitive.
" You may get one or more notices regarding your CCPA rights from businesses you interact
with in a real estate transaction.
However, not all businesses that receive or share your Pl are obligated to comply
with the CCPA.
Moreover, businesses that are otherwise covered under the CCPA may have a legal obligation
to maintain Pl, notwithstanding your instruction to the contrary.
For instance, regardless of whether they are covered by CCPA, under California law
, brokers and Multiple Listing Services are required to maintain their records for
3 years.
If you wish to exercise your rights under CCPA, where applicable, you should contact
the respective business directly.
You can obtain more information about the CCPA and your rights under the law from
the State of California Department of Justice (oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa).
Additionally, the California Privacy Protection Agency is authorized to promulgate
regulations which may further clarify requirements of the CCPA (cppa.ca.gov/regulations/
).

WATER HEATER STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE 1.
STATE LAW: California Law requires that all new and replacement water heaters and
existing residential water heaters be braced, anchored or strapped to resist falling
or horizontal displacement due to earthquake motion.
" Water heater " means any standard water heater with a capacity of no more than 120
gallons for which a pre - engineered strapping kit is readily available.
(Health and Safety Code §19211d).
Although not specifically stated, the statute requiring a statement of compliance
does not appear to apply to a properly installed and bolted tankless water heater
for the following reasons: There is no tank that can overturn;
Pre - engineered strapping kits for such devices are not readily available;
and Bolting already exists that would help avoid displacement or breakage in the event
of an earthquake.
2.
LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: Some local ordinances impose more stringent water heater bracing
, anchoring or strapping requirements than does California Law.
Therefore, it is important to check with local city or county building and safety
departments regarding the applicable water heater bracing, anchoring or strapping
requirements for your property.
3.
TRANSFEROR'S WRITTEN STATEMENT: California Health and Safety Code §19211 requires
the seller of any real property containing a water heater to certify, in writing
, that the seller is in compliance with California State Law.
If the Property is a manufactured or mobile home, Seller shall also file a required
Statement with the Department of Housing and Community Development.
4.
CERTIFICATION: Seller represents that the Property, as of the Close Of Escrow,
will be in compliance with Health and Safety Code §19211 by having the water heater
(s) braced, anchored or strapped in place, in accordance with those requirements

INSTALLATION OF CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS: A.
Requirements: California law (Health and Safety Code §§ 13260 to 13263 and 17296
to 17296.2) requires that as of July 1, 2011, all existing single - family dwellings
have carbon monoxide detectors installed and that all other types of dwelling units
intended for human occupancy have carbon monoxide detectors installed on or before
January 1, 2013.
The January 1, 2013 requirement applies to a duplex, lodging house, dormitory,
hotel, condominium, time - share and apartment, among others.
B.
Exceptions: The law does not apply to a dwelling unit which does not have any of
the following: a fossil fuel burning heater or appliance, a fireplace, or an attached
garage.
The law does not apply to dwelling units owned or leased by the State of California
, the Regents of the University of California or local government agencies.
Aside from these three owner types, there are no other owner exemptions from the
installation requirement;
it applies to all owners of dwellings, be they individual banks, corporations,
or other entities.
There is no exemption for REO properties.
DISCLOSURE OF CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS: The Health and Safety Code does not require
a disclosure regarding the existence of carbon monoxide detectors in a dwelling.
However, a seller of residential 1-4 property who is required to complete a Real
Estate Transfer Disclosure Statement, (C.A.R.
Form TDS) or a Manufactured Home and Mobile home Transfer Disclosure Statement (
C.A.R.
Form MHTDS) must use section II A of that form to disclose if the dwelling unit has
a carbon monoxide detector.
COMPLIANCE WITH INSTALLATION REQUIREMENT: State building code requires at a minimum
, placement of carbon monoxide detectors in applicable properties outside of each
sleeping area, and on each floor in a multi - level dwelling but additional or different
requirements may apply depending on local building standards and manufacturer instructions
.
An owner who fails to install a carbon monoxide detector when required by law and
continues to fail to install the detector after being given notice by a governmental
agency could be liable for a fine of up to $ 200 for each violation.
A transfer of a property where a seller, as an owner, has not installed carbon monoxide
detectors, when required to do so by law, will not be invalidated, but the seller
/ owner could be subject to damages of up to $ 100, plus court costs and attorney
fees.
Buyer and Seller are each advised to consult with their own home inspector, contractor
or building department to determine the exact location for installation of carbon
monoxide detectors.
Buyer is advised to consult with a professional of Buyer's choosing to determine whether
the property has carbon monoxide detector (s) installed as required by law, and
if not to discuss with their counsel the potential consequences.
LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: Some localities maintain their own retrofit or point of sale
requirements which may include the requirement that a carbon monoxide detector be
installed prior to a transfer of property.
Therefore, it is important to check the local city or county building and safety
departments regarding point of sale or retrofit requirements when transferring property
.

departments regarding point of sale or retrofit requirements when transferring property

(" Agreement "), is referred to as " Tenant " is referred to as " Housing Provider
".
Bed Bug Appearance: Bed bugs have six legs.
Adult bed bugs have flat bodies about 1/4 of an inch in length.
Their color can vary from red and brown to copper colored.
Young bed bugs are very small.
Their bodies are about 1/16 of an inch in length.
They have almost no color.
When a bed bug feeds, its body swells, may lengthen, and becomes bright red, sometimes
making it appear to be a different insect.
Bed bugs do not fly.
They can either crawl or be carried from place to place on objects, people, or animals
.
Bed bugs can be hard to find and identify because they are tiny and try to stay hidden
.
Life Cycle and Reproduction: An average bed bug lives for about 10 months.
Female bed bugs lay one to five eggs per day.
Bed bugs grow to full adulthood in about 21 days.
Bed bugs can survive for months without feeding.
Bed Bug Bites: Because bed bugs usually feed at night, most people are bitten in
their sleep and do not realize they were bitten.
A person's reaction to insect bites is an immune response and so varies from person
to person.
Sometimes the red welts caused by the bites will not be noticed until many days after
a person was bitten, if at all.
Common signs and symptoms of a possible bed bug infestation: Small red to reddish
brown fecal spots on mattresses, box springs, bed frames, mattresses, linens,
upholstery, or walls.
Molted bed bug skins, white, sticky eggs, or empty eggshells.
Very heavily infested areas may have a characteristically sweet odor.
Red, itchy bite marks, especially on the legs, arms, and other body parts exposed
while sleeping.
However, some people do not show bed bug lesions on their bodies even though bed
bugs may have fed on them.
For more information, see the Internet Web sites of the United States Environmental
Protection Agency and the National Pest Management Association.
7.
Tenant shall report suspected infestations by bed bugs to the Housing Provider or
Property Manager at the mailing, or email address or phone number provided in the
Agreement and cooperate with any inspection for and treatment of bed bugs.
8.
Housing Provider will notify tenants of any units inspected by a pest control operator
of the findings by such an operator within 2 business days of the receipt of the findings
.
All Tenants will be notified of confirmed infestations within common areas.
Tenant agrees to release, indemnify, hold harmless and forever discharge Housing
Provider and Housing Provider's employees, agents, successors and assigns from any
and all claims, liabilities or causes of action of any kind that Tenant, members
of Tenant's household or Tenant's guests or invitees may have at any time against
Housing Provider or Housing Provider's agents resulting from the presence of bedbugs
due to Tenant's failure to comply with this Bed Bug Disclosure.

FIRE HARDENING AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE ADVISORY: A.
California law requires certain disclosures be made concerning a property's compliance
with safeguards that may minimize the risk of a structure on the property catching
fire (fire hardening) and that an agreement be reached concerning compliance with
requirements that the area surrounding structures be maintained to minimize the risk
of the spread of wildfires (defensible space).
The fire hardening and defensible space laws only apply if, among other requirements
, the property is located in either a high or very high fire hazard severity zone
.
If there exists a final inspection report covering fire hardening or defensible space
compliance, such a report may need to be provided to the buyer.
C.A.R.
Form FHDS may be used to satisfy the legal requirements.
B.
WHERE TO LOCATE INFORMATION: Seller has the obligation to determine if compliance
with the fire hardening and defensible space requirements are applicable to Seller
and the property.
It may be possible to determine if a property is in a high or very high fire hazard
severity zone by consulting with a natural hazard zone disclosure company or reviewing
the company's report.
This information may also be available through a local agency where this information
should have been filed.

DocuSign Envelope ID: BEBBB34E - 2815-40EE - A88B - 704908D522A5 Information on Dampness
and Mold for Renters in California Main points: Living in damp or moldy buildings
increases the chances of respiratory problems like asthma.
The critical warning signs are visible mold, water damage, damp materials, or mold
smell.
 Dampness is needed for mold to grow, so if you control the dampness, you control
the mold.
 Dampness or mold indoors may make housing substandard, per the California Health
& Safety Code.
This booklet describes the increased risks to health, including specific health issues
, that may result from exposures to dampness or mold in buildings.
This booklet was produced in January 2021 by the California Department of Public Health
(CDPH) in accordance with the 2001 Toxic Mold Protection Act (HSC §26148).

DocuSign Envelope ID: BEBBB34E - 2815-40EE - A88B - 704908D522A5 Health Problems
from Damp or Moldy Buildings Living or working in damp or moldy buildings increases
the risk of many harmful health problems, including:  asthma attacks in people
who already have asthma a new asthma diagnosis.
respiratory infections, such as bronchitis  breathing symptoms, such as hay fever
, sneezing, stuffy nose, sore throat, wheezing, breathing difficulty, or cough
eczema or skin rash Mold can affect people differently.
How much a person is affected depends on how sensitive they are and on how much they
are exposed.
Damp or moldy buildings are linked to health problems in people even if they do not
have allergies.
Signs of Dampness or Mold Signs of dampness or mold that may cause health problems
include:  visible mold (regardless of color), such as on walls or ceilings,
behind furniture or appliances, under carpets, or even hidden in areas not seen
in the occupied areas of homes  mold odor, noticed as an earthy, musty, or moldy
smell  visible water damage, such as water - stains or discoloration on walls or
ceilings, peeling or bubbled paint, warped floors, or rotting wood  damp or moist
materials, including condensation on windows or walls Any one of these signs indicates
increased risks to health, and the more that any of them are present, the greater
the risk of health problems.
Tests that identify the types of mold or the amounts of mold in buildings are not
useful in telling us about the health risks.
This is why CDPH does not recommend testing for mold, such as measuring mold spores
in the air.

DocuSign Envelope ID: BEBBB34E - 2815-40EE - A88B - 704908D522A5 Causes of Building
Dampness that Can Allow Mold to Grow The dampness that is necessary for indoor mold
to grow can come from either inside or outside a building.
Indoor sources include: leaking or burst water pipes, for instance under sinks inside
walls not enough venting to the outside by open windows or exhaust fans in places
where water is used or moisture is produced (for example, bathrooms, laundry areas
, kitchens, and water heaters) condensation (water droplets) on cold surfaces
, including windows Outdoor sources include:  water coming in through leaky roofs
or poorly - sealed windows, or from flooding damp, exposed dirt in crawl spaces
 outdoor surfaces that slope and drain water toward a building, including from a
downspout Fixing Dampness and Mold Problems The California Health & Safety Code (
HSC §17920.3) says that when dampness or visible mold (or certain other conditions
) in a home is a hazard to the health of occupants, the home is substandard and the
property owner must fix the conditions.
The Code excludes mold that is " minor and found on surfaces that accumulate moisture
as part of their properly functioning and intended use.
" CDPH recommends fixing dampness and mold problems as follows:  identifying and
correcting the source of any water that may allow mold to grow rapid drying or removal
of damp materials cleaning or removing mold and moldy materials as rapidly and safely
as possible Note: if a moldy area is simply bleached, cleaned, or painted over
- without fixing the source of the dampness - the mold is likely to grow again.

DocuSign Envelope ID: BEBBB34E - 2815-40EE - A88B - 704908D522A5 Renters in California
The California Health & Safety Code requires property owners to provide a rental unit
that is safe and healthy for the people living in it.
Prospective renters should look for obvious conditions that show dampness or mold
, and also less obvious signs like water leaks under the kitchen and bathroom sinks
or moldy odor in a sealed - up home.
Also look for conditions likely to cause future problems, like a bathroom that has
no working vent fan or no window that opens, or a clothes dryer without an outside
vent.
For renters who suspect there is dampness or mold: 1.
Tell the property owner or manager.
Early detection and correction of the dampness and mold problems can reduce the risks
to your health and prevent the problem from getting worse.
2.
If your property owner will not respond to your concerns in a reasonable amount of
time, contact your local (city or county) code enforcement agency and ask for a
code enforcement officer to inspect for violations.
Many dampness or mold problems in rental homes are the responsibility of the property
owner and must be addressed by them.
However, a code enforcement officer may determine that dampness or mold in a building
results from a tenant's actions or inactions - for instance, not using available
bathroom ventilation during showers.
3.
If the local inspector determines there is a violation, they can require the property
owner to correct the problem.

code enforcement agencies, with a focus on dampness and mold, see www.cdph.ca.gov/iaq/mold
.

Property owners must provide a rental unit that is safe and healthy for the people
living in it.
Tenants must notify property owners of any dampness or mold problems.

(“ Propounding Party ”) Form Interrogatories - Unlawful Detainer (Set One) as
follows: 27 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT These responses are made only for the purpose of
the within action.

, materiality, propriety, admissibility PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO FORM INTERROGATORIES

1 2 3 4 5 6 and any other objections and grounds that would require the exclusion
of any statement herein if any document was asked of, or if any statement contained
therein were made by a witness present and testifying in court, all of which objections
and grounds are reserved and may be interposed at the time of trial.
Plaintiff is responding to all Requests to the extent that information has become
known 7 by him.
However, this Responding Party's discovery, investigation and preparation for trial
of 8 9 10 11 this matter has not been completed as of the date of these responses
, and, therefore, Plaintiff does not purport to state anything more than information
presently known and discovered by him.
Plaintiff, in responding to these Requests, reserves the right to continue discovery
and 12 investigation in this matter for facts, witnesses and supporting data that
may recall information which, if he had presently within his knowledge, would be
included in these responses.
For example, to the extent that any request calls for the identification of “ all
documents, ” it is 13 14 15 16 17 responded to fully insofar as information is presently
available to Plaintiff, and Plaintiff is not precluded from presenting at trial information
discovered after the date of the response of this 18 request.
19 20 This preliminary statement is incorporated into each of the responses set forth
below.
21 GENERAL OBJECTIONS 22 23 24 25 26 27 To avoid repetition in setting forth specific
objections to interrogatories, Responding Party sets forth and incorporates the following
objections to Responding Party's each and every response.
A.
RELEVANCY OBJECTION Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory,
in whole or in part, seek the disclosure of information that is neither relevant
to the subject matter of the action nor reasonably PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO FORM INTERROGATORIES
– UNLAWFUL DETAINER - 2 | -

--- Page 58 ---
1 calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
2 B.
CONFIDENTIALITY / PRIVACY OBJECTION 3 4 Responding Party objects on the basis that
the interrogatory seeks the disclosure of confidential information and constitutes
an attempt to invade the personal and / or financial privacy of certain 5 6 individuals
or persons.
7 8 9 10 11 C.
OVERBREADTH AND BURDEN OBJECTION Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory
is overbroad, burdensome and oppressive in that they seek the disclosure of information
that has little or no practical benefit to Propounding Party while placing an unwarranted
burden or expense on the Responding Party in 12 ascertaining such information.
Further, such interrogatory is so broadly drawn that although it 13 14 15 16 may
include some relevant information within its scope, it includes information that
is irrelevant or immaterial to the instant action.
