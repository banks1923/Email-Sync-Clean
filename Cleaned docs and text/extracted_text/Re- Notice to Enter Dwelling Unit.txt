Staff , We are prepared to accommodate necessary repairs , but a three day , nine hour day schedule is excessive given the scope of work described and creates an unreasonable burden on our household .

We are not available on March 17th , 18th , or 19th during the times you have listed .

While we have consistently worked with you to allow previous repairs , we cannot accommodate those dates and times .

Since these are non - emergency repairs , we will follow up by end of day Tuesday , March 18th with our availability so that we can coordinate accordingly and come to a mutual agreement .
