MARTINEZ ONE TO PLAINTIFF AND HIS RESPECTIVE ATTORNEYS OF RECORD: Pursuant to Sections
2030.210, et seq.
, of the California Code of Civil Procedure, 27 Defendant BRAD MARTINEZ (“ Responding
Party ”) hereby submits these objections and 28 responses to the First Set of Form
Interrogatories propounded by Plaintiff JAMES BURBANK 1 DEFENDANT BRAD MARTINEZ'S
REPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JAMES BURBANK'S FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE

1 (" Propounding Party ") as follows: 2 3 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT Responding Party
has not completed its investigation of the facts relating to this case, its 4 discovery
or its preparation for trial.
All responses and objections contained herein are based only 5 upon information that
is presently available to and specifically known by Responding Party.
It is 6 || anticipated that further discovery, independent investigation, legal
research and analysis will 7 supply additional facts and add meaning to known facts
, as well as establish entirely new factual 8 conclusions and legal contentions,
all of which may lead to substantial additions to, changes in and 9 variations from
the responses set forth herein.
10 These responses, while based on diligent inquiry and investigation by Responding
Party, 11 reflect only the current state of Responding Party's knowledge, understanding
, and belief, based 12 upon the information reasonably available to it at this time
.
As this action proceeds, and further 13 investigation and discovery are conducted
, additional or different facts and information could be 14 revealed to Responding
Party.
Moreover, Responding Party anticipates that Propounding Party 15 may make legal or
factual contentions presently unknown to and unforeseen by Responding Party 16 which
may require Responding Party to adduce further facts in rebuttal to such contentions
.
17 Consequently, Responding Party may not yet have knowledge and may not fully understand
the 18 significance of information potentially pertinent to these responses.
Accordingly, these responses are provided without prejudice to Responding Party's
right to rely upon and use any information 20 that it subsequently discovers, or
that was omitted from these responses as a result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise
, or excusable neglect.
Without in any way obligating itself to do so, 19 21 22 Responding Party reserves
the right to modify, supplement, revise, or amend these responses, and 23 to correct
any inadvertent errors or omissions which may be contained herein, in light of the
24 information that Responding Party may subsequently obtain or discover.
25 Nothing in this response should be construed as an admission by Responding Party
with 26 respect to the admissibility or relevance of any fact or document, or of
the truth or accuracy of any 27 characterization or statement of any kind contained
in Propounding Party's interrogatories.
28 Each of the following responses is made solely for the purpose of this action.
Each 2 DEFENDANT BRAD MARTINEZ'S REPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JAMES BURBANK'S FORM INTERROGATORIES
, SET ONE

1 response is subject to all objections as to relevance, materiality, and admissibility
, and to any and 2 all objections on any ground that would require exclusion of any
response if it were introduced in 3 court.
All objections and grounds are expressly reserved and may be interposed at the time
of 4 trial, hearing, or otherwise.
Furthermore, each of the objections contained herein is incorporated 5 by reference
as though fully set forth in each response.
6 The following objections and responses are made without prejudice to Responding
Party's 7 right to produce at trial, or otherwise, evidence regarding any subsequently
discovered 8 information.
Responding Party accordingly reserves the right to modify and amend any and all 9
responses herein as research is completed and contentions are made.
10 11 Nothing contained herein is to be construed as a waiver of any attorney - client
privilege, work product doctrine, or any other applicable privilege or doctrine
.
To the extent any 12 interrogatory may be construed as calling for disclosure of information
protected from discovery 13 by the attorney - client privilege, the work product
doctrine, or any other privilege or protection, a 14 continuing objection to each
and every such interrogatory is hereby interposed.
15 16 17 GENERAL OBJECTIONS TO INTERROGATORIES Responding Party generally objects
to the Interrogatories as follows: A.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
seek to 18 elicit information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of this
action, nor reasonably 19 calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence
.
20 B.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
are 21 unreasonably overbroad in scope, and thus burdensome and oppressive, in that
each such 22 interrogatory seeks information pertaining to items and matters that
are not relevant to the subject 23 matter of this action, or, if relevant, so remote
therefrom as to make its disclosure of little or no 24 practical benefit to Propounding
Party, while placing a wholly unwarranted burden and expense on 25 Responding Party
in locating, reviewing and producing the requested information.
26 C.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
are 27 burdensome and oppressive, in that ascertaining the information necessary
to respond to them 28 would require the review and compilation of information from
multiple locations, and voluminous 3 DEFENDANT BRAD MARTINEZ'S REPONSES TO PLAINTIFF
JAMES BURBANK'S FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE

1 records and files, thereby involving substantial time of employees of Responding
Party and great 2 expense to Responding Party, whereas the information sought to
be obtained by Propounding 3 Party would be of little use or benefit to Propounding
Party.
4 D.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
are 5 vague, uncertain, overbroad, and without limitation as to time or specific
subject matter.
6 E.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
seek 7 information at least some of which is protected by the attorney - client privilege
or the attorney 8 work - product doctrine, or both.
9 F.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
seek to 10 have Responding Party furnish information that is a matter of the public
record, and therefore is 11 equally available to the Propounding Party as they are
to Responding Party.
12 G.
Responding Party objects generally to the Interrogatories to the extent that they
seek to 13 have Responding Party furnish information that is proprietary to Responding
Party and contain 14 confidential information.
15 H.
Responding Party objects to the interrogatories, and to any individual interrogatory
set 16 forth therein, to the extent that they are compound and constitute an impermissible
effort to 17 circumvent the 35 special interrogatory limit set by Section 2030.030
of the California Code of 18 Civil Procedure.
19 I.
Responding Party expressly incorporates each of the foregoing General Objections into
20 each specific response to the interrogatories set forth below as if set forth in
full therein.
An answer to an interrogatory is not intended to be a waiver of any applicable specific
or general 22 objection to such interrogatory.
21 23 24 26 Without waiver of the foregoing, Responding Party further responds as
follows: RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES 25 FORM INTERROGATORY NO.

24 Responding Party objects to this request to the extent the term “ material ” is
vague and ambiguous, 25 requiring Responding Party to speculate as to the response
sought.
Responding Party has filed a 26 general denial of the Complaint pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure §431.30.
All affirmative 27 defenses alleged by Responding Party are made for the specific
purpose of preserving Responding 28 Party's rights under a number of possible scenarios
which may develop before or during trial.
The 22 DEFENDANT BRAD MARTINEZ'S REPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JAMES BURBANK'S FORM INTERROGATORIES
, SET ONE

1 || affirmative defenses may or may not become relevant depending on the information
2 revealed / obtained during the litigation and at trial.
Responding Party is entitled to do this under 3 the Code of Civil Procedure.
An investigation has been undertaken on behalf of Responding Party;
4 however, the nature and scope of this investigation and the attendant work product
, the identity of 5 any of Responding Party's attorney's agent (s) (prior to,
if applicable, designation as an expert 7 6 witness pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§2034) and the identity of any individual (s) who may or may not have been contacted
by Responding Party's attorneys, or their agents, is protected by 8 privacy, work
product, and attorney - client privileges as embodied in Article I, Section 1 of
the 9 California Constitution, Code of Civil Procedure §2018, Evidence Code §950
, et.
seq.
, and case 10 law, including Soltani - Rastegar v.
Superior Court, (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 424.
Responding Party 11 also objects to this Request on the grounds that it is premature
as Responding Party has not had 12 sufficient opportunity to complete its investigation
and discovery.
Further, expert designations and 13 depositions have not taken place, and information
obtained during deposition, as well as 14 information presented at trial may support
the denials and affirmative defenses raised by 15 Responding Party.
Many of the defenses are primarily based on expert witness testimony, and / or 16
facts gleamed from such testimony.
Responding Party's procedural defenses are raised in order to 17 preserve the viability
and availability of these defenses pending further discovery and trial.
Subject to and without waiving these objections, Responding Party states as follows
: 18 19 a.
Responding Party filed a number of affirmative defenses, which may become 20 relevant
as the discovery process reveals more information.
This is done as a matter of course to 21 preserve all possible defenses, including
those of which Responding Party may still be unaware of 22 at the time the Answer
was filed.
These affirmative defenses asserted by the Responding Party 23 may or may not become
relevant depending upon the information revealed through the course of 24 discovery
in this matter.
Furthermore, some of these affirmative defenses set forth legal defenses 25 that
are not factual.
Further, Plaintiffs ' complaint provides insufficient details to identify any 26
alleged breaches or wrongful conduct, and public records do not reflect any relevant
complaints, 27 so Defendants are unaware of any specific conditions as alleged in
the Complaint.
Affirmative 28 defenses raised in Responding Party's Answer to Plaintiff's Complaint
have been asserted in order 23 DEFENDANT BRAD MARTINEZ'S REPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JAMES
BURBANK'S FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE

1 to not waive those affirmative defenses.
California Academy of Sciences v.
County of Fresno 2 (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1436, 1442.
Further, those affirmative defenses were pled in order to 3 protect Responding Party's
affirmative defenses in the event discovery and investigation reveal a 4 basis for
them.
Discovery has not yet been completed, and the facts upon which Responding 5 Party's
affirmative defenses are based have yet to be fully developed.
6 7 b.
C.
Plaintiffs;
and Defendant, who may be contacted through counsel of record;
Pursuant to C.C.P.
§ 2030.230, Responding Party directs Propounding Party to the 8 following documents
: Plaintiffs ' document production;
and Responding Party's document 9 || production.
10 Additionally, as the discovery phase is still open and active, it is premature
to make a 11 determination as to which affirmative defenses relative to these issues
are appropriate.
Responding 12 Party presently has insufficient knowledge or information on which to
form a belief as to whether 13 Responding Party may have additional affirmative defenses
.
Responding Party has therefore 14 reserved the right to assert those affirmative defenses
which discovery would indicate are 15 appropriate.
16 Discovery is ongoing and Responding Party reserves the right to amend, modify

discovery process.
