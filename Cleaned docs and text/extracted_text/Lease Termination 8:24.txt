Brad Martinez brad_martinez@att.net , jamesburbank91@gmail.com Dear Vicki and Brad , JB I want to clarify that , under the Fair Housing Act ( FHA ) , I'm not required to sign additional documents for my emotional support animal to be approved .

Approval should be based on the documentation I've already provided .

I'd also appreciate an update on the status of the non - renewal notice from June 19 , 2024 .

Since my emotional support animal has been disclosed and a formal request made , the no - animal policy no longer applies as a reason for non - renewal .

Additionally , the alteration was acknowledged on May 22 , 2024 , with no further action requested .

Given these points , I'm hoping you can confirm whether the non - renewal is still in effect and , if so , on what grounds .

Brad Martinez brad_martinez@att.net , jamesburbank91@gmail.com Dear Jennifer , Section 13 of the signed lease states that no animal or pet shall be kept on or about the premises without our prior written consent .

If this process had been followed originally , we would have asked for the ATCA to be completed .

It is standard practice and protects both you as the tenant and us as the landlords .

VM Secondly , the dog is already on property so the accommodation approval is not really in question here .

If there is a particular section of the agreement that you are not comfortable with , please be specific in letting us know .

Lastly , page 20 of the lease agreement outlines why the property located at 518 N.

Stoneman Ave.

Alhambra CA 91801 is exempt from both rent cap and just cause eviction laws .

The attached letter serves as your notice of this exemption .

Dear Vicki and Brad , I want to clarify that , under the Fair Housing Act ( FHA ) , I'm not required to sign additional documents for my emotional support animal to be approved .

Approval should be based on the documentation I've already provided .

I'd also appreciate an update on the status of the non - renewal notice from June 19 , 2024 .

Since my emotional support animal has been disclosed and a formal request made , the no - animal policy no longer applies as a reason for non - renewal .

Additionally , the alteration was acknowledged on May 22 , 2024 , with no further action requested .

Given these points , I'm hoping you can confirm whether the non - renewal is still in effect and , if so , on what grounds .

VM In the first communication sent on June 19 , 2024 you were provided a greater than 60 - day notice that the lease would not be renewed .

The communication sent August 23 , 2024 was only provided as a reminder and in no way supersedes the original notification .

As stated in the August 23,2024 email , we are more than willing to consider your request for more time , however that needs to be communicated clearly so that an agreement can be reached .

You are welcome to stay until September 15,2024 if that is your preference .

jamesburbank91@gmail.com , Brad Martinez brad_martinez@att.net Dear Vicki and Brad , JB The notice sent on June 19 , 2024 , clearly stated a vacate date of September 15 , 2024 , and included specific terms .

In contrast , the notice sent on August 23 , 2024 , lists a different vacate date of September 8 , 2024 , along with additional updated terms .

Given that these notices contain different vacate dates and terms , they are entirely separate and different notices .

The notice provided on August 23 , 2024 , cannot reasonably be considered a " reminder " of the original notice , as it alters both the vacate date and the terms .

Unless you are indicating that you have decided to change the original notice's vacate date and terms and are now attempting to pass the August 23 , 2024 , notice as a continuation of the original notice from June 19 , 2024 .

Can you please confirm which notice is in effect ?

Is it the first notice sent on June 19 , 2024 or the second notice sent on August 23 , 2024 ?

Dear Jennifer , To clarify , the vacate day of 9/8/24 is in accordance with the original lease .

In the first communication sent on June 19 , 2024 you were provided a greater than 60 - day notice that the lease would not be renewed .

The communication sent August 23 , 2024 was only provided as a reminder and in no way supersedes the original notification .

As stated in the August 23,2024 email , we are more than willing to consider your request for more time , however that needs to be communicated clearly so that an agreement can be reached .

You are welcome to stay until September 15,2024 if that is your preference .

Would that be your preference ?

Dear Vicki and Brad , I want to clarify the Fair Housing Act protects my right to reasonable accommodations without additional requirements .

The approval of my emotional support animal is not dependent on this document .

That said , I am willing to sign the addendum in good faith , as a gesture of cooperation , not out of legal obligation .

Please note that signing this addendum does not change or modify the terms of the initial lease agreement in any way .

I trust this will formalize the accommodation and ensure clarity for both parties moving forward .

Additionally , I would like to follow up on the status of the non - renewal notification .

Dear Vicki and Brad , I want to clarify that , under the Fair Housing Act ( FHA ) , I'm not required to sign additional documents for my emotional support animal to be approved .

Approval should be based on the documentation I've already provided .

I'd also appreciate an update on the status of the non - renewal notice from June 19 , 2024.

Since my emotional support animal has been disclosed and a formal request made , the no - animal policy no longer applies as a reason for non - renewal .

Additionally , the alteration was acknowledged on May 22 , 2024 , with no further action requested .

Given these points , I'm hoping you can confirm whether the non- renewal is still in effect and , if so , on what grounds .

Dear Vicki and Brad , I want to clarify the Fair Housing Act protects my right to reasonable accommodations without additional requirements .

The approval of my emotional support animal is not dependent on this document .

That said , I am willing to sign the addendum in good faith , as a gesture of cooperation , not out of legal obligation Please note that signing this addendum does not change or modify the

I trust this will formalize the accommodation and ensure clarity for both parties moving forward .

Additionally , I would like to follow up on the status of the non - renewal notification .

Please confirm whether it is still in effect , and if so , on what grounds .

Dear Vicki and Brad , I want to clarify that , under the Fair Housing Act ( FHA ) , I'm not required to sign additional documents for my emotional support animal to be approved .

Approval should be based on the documentation I've already provided .

I'd also appreciate an update on the status of the non - renewal notice from June 19 , 2024.

Since my emotional support animal has been disclosed and a formal request made , the no - animal policy no longer applies as a reason for non - renewal .

Additionally , the alteration was acknowledged on May 22 , 2024 , with no further action requested .

Given these points , I'm hoping you can confirm whether the non - renewal is still in effect and , if so , on what grounds .

Dear Vicki and Brad , I want to reiterate , I am formally requesting a reasonable accommodation for my emotional support animal .

Attached to this email is the medical documentation that supports the need for my emotional support animal .

Please confirm whether my request for a reasonable accommodation is being approved or denied .

It is important to note that the request for a reasonable accommodation should be addressed accordingly and in a timely manner .

I am open to discussing this matter further .

I noticed that a new email thread was started on August 9 , 2024.

However , this new thread does not include the previous communication in which I formally requested a reasonable accommodation for my emotional support animal .

For clarity and to ensure that all relevant information is easily accessible , I am attaching a copy of my initial email , dated August 5 , 2024 , which contains my request for a reasonable accommodation .

To avoid any confusion , I ask that we keep all related communications about this matter within this same email thread moving forward .

Dear Vicki and Brad , I received your email regarding the lease termination and scheduling the walk - through .

However , addressing my request for accommodation of my emotional support animal is important .

Therefore , I would like to follow up on my previous email ( sent August 5 , 2024 ) in which I requested an accommodation for my emotional support animal .

I have not yet received a response to that request and would appreciate confirmation of receipt and a response .

To clarify , I am requesting that my emotional support animal be accommodated under the terms of the lease .

Please let me know if my request has been accepted and if you need any additional information .

I look forward to your prompt response to ensure this matter is addressed .
