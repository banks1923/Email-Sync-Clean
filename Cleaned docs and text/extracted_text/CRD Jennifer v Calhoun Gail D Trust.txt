Dear Complainant: You contacted our office alleging incidents of housing discrimination

signed by you and any other complainants listed.
Please review the complaint, and if acceptable, please sign and date the complaint
using DocuSign.
If you are unable to use DocuSign, please notify me at R9Intakelnbox8@hud.gov, and
I can provide you the complaint in an alternative format.

and to state or local fair housing agencies which administer substantially equivalent
fair housing laws for complaint processing.

it will result in the delay or denial of HUD assistance.
