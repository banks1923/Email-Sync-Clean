One BRADFORD M.

MARTINEZ ( " Responding Party ” ) hereby provides its response to JENNIFER BURBANK'S ( “ Propounding Party ” ) Form Interrogatories - Unlawful Detainer ( Set One ) as follows :

27 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT These responses are made only for the purpose of the within action .

Each response or answer is subject to all objections as to competence , relevance , materiality , propriety , admissibility PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO FORM INTERROGATORIES – UNLAWFUL DETAINER - 1 -

--- Page 2 --- 1 2 3 4 5 6 and any other objections and grounds that would require the exclusion of any statement herein if any document was asked of , or if any statement contained therein were made by a witness present and testifying in court , all of which objections and grounds are reserved and may be interposed at the time of trial .

Plaintiff is responding to all Requests to the extent that information has become known 7 by him .

However , this Responding Party's discovery , investigation and preparation for trial of 8 9 10 11 this matter has not been completed as of the date of these responses , and , therefore , Plaintiff does not purport to state anything more than information presently known and discovered by him .

Plaintiff , in responding to these Requests , reserves the right to continue discovery and 12 investigation in this matter for facts , witnesses and supporting data that may recall information which , if he had presently within his knowledge , would be included in these responses .

For example , to the extent that any request calls for the identification of “ all documents , ” it is 13 14 15 16 17 responded to fully insofar as information is presently available to Plaintiff , and Plaintiff is not precluded from presenting at trial information discovered after the date of the response of this 18 request .

19 20 This preliminary statement is incorporated into each of the responses set forth below .

21 GENERAL OBJECTIONS 22 23 24 25 26 27 To avoid repetition in setting forth specific objections to interrogatories , Responding Party sets forth and incorporates the following objections to Responding Party's each and every response .

A.

RELEVANCY OBJECTION Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory , in whole or in part , seek the disclosure of information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of the action nor reasonably PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO FORM INTERROGATORIES – UNLAWFUL DETAINER - 2 | -

--- Page 3 --- 1 calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence .

2 B.

CONFIDENTIALITY / PRIVACY OBJECTION 3 4 Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory seeks the disclosure of confidential information and constitutes an attempt to invade the personal and / or financial privacy of certain 5 6 individuals or persons .

7 8 9 10 11 C.

OVERBREADTH AND BURDEN OBJECTION Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is overbroad , burdensome and oppressive in that they seek the disclosure of information that has little or no practical benefit to Propounding Party while placing an unwarranted burden or expense on the Responding Party in 12 ascertaining such information .

Further , such interrogatory is so broadly drawn that although it 13 14 15 16 may include some relevant information within its scope , it includes information that is irrelevant or immaterial to the instant action .

Such interrogatory seeks information which is cumulative and / or would require the compilation of extensive and detailed information from numerous 17 potential sources , many of which is not easily identifiable or available .

A search for all such 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 information will in many instances involve enormous amounts of time by Responding Party .

Further , the interrogatory is so overbroad such that it is uncertain what information is sought .

D.

AMBIGUITY OBJECTION Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is phrased in language that is vague , ambiguous , and uncertain such that Responding Party is unable to ascertain what information is sought and in order to respond to this interrogatory , Responding Party would have to speculate as to Propounding Party's intended meaning .

E.

AVAILABILITY OBJECTION Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is equally accessible to all parties PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO FORM INTERROGATORIES – UNLAWFUL DETAINER - 3 -

--- Page 4 --- 1 or is more accessible to the Propounding Party or which is maintained primarily by persons or 2 entities other than Responding Party .

3 F.

IMPROPER FORM OBJECTION 4 5 6 Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory is phrased in improper form because the interrogatory is not “ full and complete in and of itself " ; or because it contains subpart , 7 " compound , conjunctive or disjunctive ” question , such that the interrogatory does not comply with 8 the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure §2030.060 9 G.

LEGAL CONCLUSION OBJECTION 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 222 22 Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory calls for a legal conclusion .

H.

ATTORNEY WORK - PRODUCT OBJECTION Responding Party objects on the basis that the interrogatory , in whole or in part , seeks disclosure of information that is protected under the attorney work - product doctrine .

I.

MARITAL PRIVILEGE OBJECTION Responding Party objects on the basis that the request , in whole or in part , seeks disclosure of information that is protected under marital privilege .
