CODEBASE CLEANUP SUMMARY
========================
Date: August 18, 2025

=== CLEANUP ACCOMPLISHED ===

1. ARCHIVE FOLDER CREATED
   ✓ Created archive_old_pipeline/ at project root
   ✓ Organized with subfolders: backup_files/, test_files/, docs/

2. BACKUP FILES ARCHIVED (52 files)
   ✓ Moved all *.backup files to archive_old_pipeline/backup_files/
   ✓ Includes knowledge graph, transcription, and script backups
   ✓ No longer cluttering main codebase navigation

3. OUTDATED TEST FILES ARCHIVED
   ✓ Moved tests/transcription/test_quality_filter.py (878 lines)
   ✓ Test file for removed quality filter system
   ✓ Reduces test complexity and maintenance burden

4. TEMPORARY FILES REMOVED (5 files)
   ✓ Removed tmp* files from data/originals/pdfs/
   ✓ Files: tmp_82dcety.pdf, tmptpoo6n55.pdf, tmp79_bf9d9.pdf, etc.
   ✓ Cleaner data directory structure

5. DATABASE LOCATION FIXED
   ✓ Database now properly located in data/emails.db (14MB)
   ✓ Removed empty email_sync.db from root
   ✓ Updated default paths in shared/simple_db.py and transcription/main.py
   ✓ No more database files created in project root

=== IMPACT ===

File Reduction:
- 52 backup files archived (removed from main navigation)
- 1 large test file archived (878 lines)
- 5 temporary files deleted
- 1 empty database file removed

Code Quality:
- Cleaner project navigation
- Reduced file clutter
- Proper database organization
- Better separation of current vs archived code

Database Organization:
- Single source of truth: data/emails.db
- No more root directory pollution
- Proper data directory structure maintained

=== ARCHIVE CONTENTS ===

archive_old_pipeline/backup_files/:
- Knowledge graph backups (graph_queries.py.backup, etc.)
- Transcription system backups (whisper_provider.py.backup, etc.)
- Script backups (legal_handler.py.backup, etc.)
- Total: 52 backup files

archive_old_pipeline/test_files/:
- test_quality_filter.py (878 lines - old transcription quality tests)

=== CURRENT STATE ===

✓ Cleaner project root directory
✓ Database properly organized in data/
✓ Backup files safely archived
✓ Temporary files removed
✓ Configuration updated for proper database paths
✓ All changes tested and working

=== NOTES ===

The archive_old_pipeline/ folder contains all removed items for future reference.
Database configuration now defaults to data/emails.db instead of root directory.
All services tested and confirmed working with new database path.

Next time you run the system, databases will be created in the proper data/ directory.
