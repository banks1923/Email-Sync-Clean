Subject: Re: Lease Agreement Issues

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out about the lease agreement. I've reviewed the document and have a few concerns:

1. The security deposit amount seems higher than the state maximum
2. The late fee structure needs clarification
3. The maintenance responsibilities section is vague

Let's schedule a call to discuss these points in detail.

Best regards,
John

John,

I'm writing to follow up on our previous conversation about the new lease agreement. As discussed, there are several clauses that need your immediate attention:

The property located at 123 Main Street has specific requirements that aren't addressed in the standard agreement. Particularly:
- Pet policy modifications
- Parking space allocation
- Utility payment arrangements

Please review the attached document and provide your feedback by end of week. This is time-sensitive as the current tenant's lease expires at the end of the month.

Additionally, I've noticed that the inspection report from last month highlighted several issues that should be addressed before the new tenant moves in:
- Water damage in the basement
- HVAC system maintenance needed
- Fence repairs in the backyard

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
